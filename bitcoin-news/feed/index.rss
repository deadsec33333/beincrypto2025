										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has urged market participants to &#8220;buy everything&#8221; following recent signals from the US Federal Reserve.</strong></p>



<p>In an April 11 post on X, Hayes suggested that investors consider broad exposure to the crypto markets as central banks show signs of stepping in to stabilize the system.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-hayes-sees-market-stress-as-cue-to-buy-bitcoin">Hayes Sees Market Stress as Cue to Buy Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Hayes previously pointed to rising bond yields, particularly the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-10-year-treasury-yield-bitcoin-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year US Treasury rate</a> climbing above 4.5%, as a potential trigger for government intervention. </p>



<p>He argued that such pressure could force the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/stealth-quantitative-easing-fed-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fed to inject fresh liquidity</a>, creating <a href="https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-tariff-war-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorable conditions for risk assets—especially Bitcoin</a>. According to <a href="https://x.com/CryptoHayes/status/1910756361409094057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hayes</a>, this scenario could lead to a prolonged upward move in crypto and broader markets.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We will be getting more policy response this weekend if this keeps up. We are about to enter UP ONLY mode for BTC,&#8221; Hayes <a href="https://x.com/CryptoHayes/status/1910707923824894114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Fed’s stance appears to support this view. Susan Collins, President of the Boston Federal Reserve, recently told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0273371d-b90c-43e4-845a-e51982dd4fdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> that while the markets are still functioning properly, the Fed stands ready to act if liquidity becomes strained.</p>



<p>Collins emphasized that the central bank has tools in place to ensure market stability if disruptions emerge. However, She stressed that the rate cuts are not the Fed’s first line of defense as other tools are available to stabilize financial markets when needed.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;The core interest rate tool we use for monetary policy is, certainly not the only tool in the toolkit and probably not the best way to address challenges of liquidity or market functioning<em>,</em>&#8221; she said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These developments come at a time when the global economy is already under stress. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-assets-tariff-volatility-inflation-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs</a> has added fresh uncertainty to financial markets.</p>



<p>Though the administration paused its new tariff schedule for 90 days, it sharply increased duties on Chinese goods to 145%. China has since responded with its own tariff hikes, lifting <a href="https://beincrypto.com/china-raises-us-tariffs-crypto-steady/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rates on American imports from 84% to as much as 125%</a>.</p>



<p>These tit-for-tat measures have raised fears of an inflation spike in the US, along with possible job losses and weaker economic growth. Wall Street has already experienced a significant selloff, and US Treasury markets are showing signs of strain.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the short-term suspension of new trade penalties, underlying tensions remain high. For Hayes, however, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-raise-debt-ceiling-will-crypto-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">combination of macro stress</a> and central bank intervention presents a clear signal: this may be the moment to accumulate assets before the tide turns.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The US Dollar Index's significant drop has raised hopes among crypto investors for a Bitcoin rally, with historical data suggesting potential for impressive gains.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The US Dollar Index (DXY), which measures the dollar&#8217;s value against a basket of foreign currencies, has dropped to a three-year low. The decline</strong> <strong>contrasts with gold&#8217;s performance, which hit an all-time high of $3,220 amid rising trade war tensions.</strong></p>



<p>Yet, DXY&#8217;s dip has sparked optimism among cryptocurrency investors. Many see the weakening dollar as a bullish signal for Bitcoin (BTC), which has recently shown signs of modest recovery.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-will-bitcoin-rally-following-the-dxy-index-s-fall">Will Bitcoin Rally Following the DXY Index’s Fall?</h2>



<p>Data shows <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">that the<a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/protect-yourself-from-inflation-using-cryptocurrency" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> DXY index dropped by 1.5% in the last 24 hours</a>. As of press time, it</span> stood at 99.4, marking its lowest level since April 2022. The decline is part of a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-raise-debt-ceiling-will-crypto-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broader trend in 2025</a>, with the DXY down 8.3% since January. </p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;The US dollar index dropped to its lowest level in nearly three years amid capital outflows from American assets. Escalating trade tensions and growing concerns over broader economic fallout, particularly for the US, have weighed heavily on market sentiment,&#8221; CryptoQuant&#8217;s Alex Adler told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Notably, the index’s fall below 100 marks a critical threshold. Historical data highlights a strong correlation between a declining DXY and substantial Bitcoin price surges. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2548" height="1369" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/bitcoin-vs-dxy.png" alt="Bitcoin Vs.

DXY Performance. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The last two times the DXY fell below the 100 mark<span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">—in April 2017 and May 2020—Bitcoin experienced significant, months-long rallies. </span>These substantial increases have led to speculation<a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-benefit-weak-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> that history could repeat itself</a>. If it does, Bitcoin could potentially be poised for another major surge.</p>



<p>Interestingly, Bitcoin has already shown signs of recovery after the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">90-day tariff pause</a>. The largest cryptocurrency reclaimed the $80,000 level, signaling renewed investor confidence. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to BeInCrypto data,</a> Bitcoin appreciated by 0.8% over the past 24 hours. This reflected minor but positive gains that suggest momentum could be building.</p>



<p>In fact, the market watchers on X (formerly Twitter) share a similar outlook.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Weak dollar is going to be a surprising tailwind for emerging markets this year that wasn’t on anyone’s bingo card,” a user <a href="https://x.com/mark_ledain/status/1910519259928940713" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Meanwhile, an analyst observed that the US dollar’s decline has occurred despite the Federal Reserve&#8217;s failure to<a target="_blank" href="https://beincrypto.com/odds-of-quantitative-easing-crypto-market/" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reduce interest rates or implement quantitative easing (QE)</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Traditionally, DXY going down is very bullish for BTC,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The analyst also highlighted a notable bearish divergence on the charts. Thus, he predicted that the dollar could potentially drop to 90, signaling a further decline in its value.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="1835" height="883" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoNoYChXgAEUCVh.png" alt="DXY index Bearish Divergence" class="wp-image-686138" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoNoYChXgAEUCVh.png 1835w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoNoYChXgAEUCVh-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoNoYChXgAEUCVh-850x409.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoNoYChXgAEUCVh-768x370.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoNoYChXgAEUCVh-1536x739.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GoNoYChXgAEUCVh-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1835px) 100vw, 1835px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">DXY Index Bearish Divergence.

<p>Similarly, another analyst described DXY’s decline as “one of the best anticipated macro moves ahead.”</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Each time this has happened in the past, it resulted in a massive bull market for Bitcoin, Crypto, and stocks,” Jackis <a href="https://x.com/i_am_jackis/status/1910621549389881373" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remarked</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also acknowledged that the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-causes-bitcoins-volatility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">markets have been slow to react</a>, attributing this delay to a lag of more than three months. Additionally, he noted that the ongoing bond situation<a href="https://beincrypto.com/china-raises-us-tariffs-crypto-steady/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> between China and the US</a>, driven by escalating trade tensions, is contributing to this slow reaction. </p>



<p>Yet, he believes this situation will either be resolved through a deal between the two countries or the Federal Reserve will intervene by buying long-term bonds to stabilize the market. Now, the coming weeks will be crucial to determine whether Bitcoin will actually enter another bull run or <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-decline-miners-join-selloff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">falter under geopolitical tensions and broader market shifts</a>.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Amid global economic volatility, the United States has again raised its debt ceiling to avert a default and ensure the government’s operations continue smoothly.</strong></p>



<p>The US debt ceiling is a legal limit on the amount the federal government can borrow to meet its financial obligations, including pension payments, social welfare programs like Social Security and Medicare, and interest on government bonds.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-us-debt-ceiling-increase">US Debt Ceiling Increase</h2>



<p>Raising the debt ceiling remains contentious, often sparking heated debates between Congress and the White House. Negotiations over spending and budgets are typically prolonged and complex.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2106" height="1078" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling.png" alt="US debt. Source: PGPF" class="wp-image-686035" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling.png 2106w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling-360x184.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling-850x435.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling-768x393.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling-1536x786.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling-2048x1048.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/us-debt-ceiling-150x77.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2106px) 100vw, 2106px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">U.S. debt. Source: <a href="https://www.pgpf.org/national-debt-clock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PGPF</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.jec.senate.gov/public/vendor/_accounts/JEC-R/debt/Monthly%20Debt%20Update.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data </a>from the Senate Joint Economic Committee (JEC), the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-national-debt-interest-rates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US national debt</a> has surpassed $36.2 trillion as of April 2025. This marks a significant rise from $22 trillion in March 2019, highlighting the rapid escalation of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-national-debt-alarm-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">national debt</a> in recent years.</p>



<p>Historically, raising the debt ceiling is not uncommon. According to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2023/04/29/1172894580/congress-has-revised-the-debt-ceiling-78-times-since-1960-a-financial-historian-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NPR</a>, since 1960, Congress has acted 78 times to increase, temporarily extend, or revise the debt ceiling definition—49 times under Republican and 29 times under Democratic presidents. This reflects the recurring need to adjust the ceiling to maintain government functionality, but it also raises questions about the long-term sustainability of US fiscal policy.</p>



<p>Under President Donald Trump’s administration, bold economic policies are being implemented, including using tariff revenues to service debt. Trump has imposed a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trump-china-tariffs-crypto-stocks-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">125% tariff on Chinese goods</a>, prompting retaliatory <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-crashes-below-75k-us-china-tariff-war-escalates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">84% tariffs</a> from China on the US. imports. </p>



<p>Consequently, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/chinese-yuan-18-year-low-bullish-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chinese yuan (CNY) has hit an 18-year low</a>, with the USD/CNY rate reaching 7.394. The yuan’s depreciation escalates trade tensions and ripple effects across cryptocurrency markets.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-impact-on-crypto">Impact on Crypto</h2>



<p>The increase in the US debt ceiling has multifaceted implications for the crypto market, both in the short and long term.</p>



<p>Raising the debt ceiling helps the US avoid default, preventing a potential global financial crisis. This often reassures investors, boosting confidence in traditional financial markets like stocks and US Treasury bonds. As a result, demand for safe-haven assets like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a>—usually viewed as a hedge during economic uncertainty—may decline.</p>



<p>Historical trends support this. During past debt ceiling crises, such as in 2021, Bitcoin prices surged as investors feared a US default. However, the pressure eased once the ceiling was raised, prompting some investors to shift capital back to traditional assets. This can create downward price pressure on Bitcoin and other altcoins.</p>



<p>Additionally, a weaker yuan due to US policies could drive capital from China into cryptocurrencies, potentially providing a positive push for the market.</p>



<p>Continually raising the debt ceiling allows the US government to borrow more to fund spending, often leading to increased money printing or issuance of Treasury bonds. This process expands the money supply, fueling inflation and eroding the US dollar’s value.</p>



<p>Cryptocurrencies, particularly Bitcoin, are often regarded as an “<a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-inflation-hedge-tech-stock-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inflation hedge</a>” due to their fixed supply and decentralized nature. Investors increasingly turn to alternative assets to preserve wealth as the dollar weakens. Bitcoin, often dubbed “digital gold,” has proven its resilience during past economic instability.</p>



<p>The increase in the US debt ceiling has a complex impact on cryptocurrencies. In the short term, it may reduce demand for safe-haven assets like Bitcoin as confidence in traditional markets grows. </p>



<p>However, in the long term, persistent debt ceiling hikes could drive inflation and weaken the dollar, positioning cryptocurrencies as a compelling hedge and alternative asset class.</p>

<p><strong>Crypto markets will witness over $2.5 billion worth of Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) options expire today.</strong></p>



<p>Traders are particularly attentive to this event because it has the potential to influence short-term trends through the volume of contracts due for expiry and their notional value. Examining the put-to-call ratios and maximum pain points can provide insights into traders’ expectations and possible market directions.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-and-ethereum-options-expiring-today">Bitcoin and Ethereum Options Expiring Today</h2>



<p>The notional value of today’s expiring BTC options is $2.23 billion. According to Deribit’s data, these 27,657 expiring Bitcoin options have a put-to-call ratio of 0.86. This ratio suggests a prevalence of purchase options (calls) over sales options (puts).</p>



<p>The data also reveals that the maximum pain point for these expiring options is $81,000. In&nbsp;<a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-options-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto options trading</a>, the maximum pain point is the price at which most contracts expire worthless. Here, the asset will cause the greatest number of&nbsp;holders’ financial losses.</p>

<p>In addition to Bitcoin options, 183,468 Ethereum contracts are set to expire today. These expiring options have a notional value of $283.6 million and a put-to-call ratio of 0.92. The maximum pain point is $1,700.</p>

<p>The current market prices for Bitcoin and Ethereum are below their respective maximum pain points. BTC is trading at <a href="https://beincrypto.com/price/bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$80,622</a>, while ETH sits at <a href="https://beincrypto.com/price/ethereum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1,543</a>.</p>

<p>“With recent market volatility and ongoing tariff developments, how do you think these expiries will impact price action?” Deribit <a href="https://x.com/DeribitOfficial/status/1910234040881594686" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posed</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Deribit is a crypto <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-options-trading-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">options and futures exchange</a>. Indeed, crypto markets are reeling from massive volatility induced by the trade war chaos following <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Trump’s tariffs</a>. Meanwhile, Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson says future tariffs will be ineffective on crypto.</p>



<p>He thinks that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/hoskinson-predicts-bitcoin-to-250k/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tariffs are already priced </a>and that future announcements will be a ‘dud’ for the crypto market.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-traders-brace-for-extended-weakness-as-call-premium-fades-until-september">Traders Brace for Extended Weakness as Call Premium Fades Until September</h2>



<p>Elsewhere, analysts at Deribit note a shift in crypto options, with short-term dips still bringing put demand. Meanwhile, the call premium is further out of the curve and fades.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“You now have to look all the way to September before calls retake the skew. Traders might be bracing for extended weakness,” Deribit <a href="https://x.com/DeribitOfficial/status/1910217136552698343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">noted</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This suggests traders might be bracing for extended weakness in the crypto market. A fading call premium, where the implied volatility (IV) of calls drops relative to puts, suggests that traders are less optimistic about price increases in the near to medium term.</p>



<p>A negative or reverse volatility skew, where OTM puts ((out-of-the-money puts) have higher IV than OTM calls ((out-of-the-money calls), is common in equity markets when investors fear price drops.</p>



<p>This pattern appears to play out in the crypto options market, reflecting heightened concerns about downside risks. Analysts at Greeks.live note that BTC&#8217;s IV has declined significantly and is now largely holding nearly 50% across all maturities.</p>



<p>On the other hand, ETH&#8217;s IV has maintained a higher level, with short to medium-term volatility holding near 80%. Selling ETH options in the short term would be a good trade for traders.</p>



<p>Global economic uncertainty, including the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-market-surges-trump-pauses-tariffs-except-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US-China tariff war</a>, has dampened risk appetite. Crypto’s inherent volatility could also be fueling this cautious outlook.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Sentiment was more panicky this week, with Trump&#8217;s frequent switching of tariff policies making the market extremely risk averse,” analysts at Greeks.live <a href="https://x.com/GreeksLive/status/1910555517581414563" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>. &nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Greeks.live analysts agree with Deribit’s expectations of extended weakness. However, unlike Hoskinson, they expect continued uncertainty and volatility in the market for a long time.</p>



<p>For traders, this suggests a need for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-bitcoin-options" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hedging strategies</a>, like buying puts or diversifying into stablecoins.</p>

<p>“Cryptocurrencies are currently suffering from a lack of new incoming money, a lack of new narratives, and a more subdued investor sentiment. In this worse market of bulls to bears, the probability of a black swan will be significantly higher, and buying some deep vanilla puts would be a good choice,” Greeks.live analysts concluded.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>New data shows Bitcoin has consistently outperformed Ethereum in investor profitability for over two years. Despite recent losses, Ethereum's undervaluation and potential for recovery may offer new opportunities.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>New data from Glassnode suggests that Bitcoin&#8217;s MVRV (Market Value to Realized Value) has been higher than Ethereum&#8217;s for 812 consecutive days. This means that the average BTC investor has accumulated much larger profits than their ETH counterpart since 2023.</strong></p>



<p>Due to recent losses, Ethereum&#8217;s MVRV actually fell below 1.0, suggesting that the average investor has lost money. It may be undervalued and well-posed for a resurgence, but this will take time.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-vs-ethereum-which-is-more-profitable">Bitcoin vs Ethereum: Which is More Profitable?</h2>



<p>Despite a few <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-crashes-below-75k-us-china-tariff-war-escalates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent market turmoils</a>, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price of Bitcoin</a> is doing reasonably well right now. Although much of its gains since Trump&#8217;s election have been wiped out, its pre-election value spent most of 2024 at a shelf near its previous all-time high. </p>



<p>According to new <a href="https://x.com/glassnode/status/1910293688095306101" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">data</a> from Glassnode, Bitcoin&#8217;s investor profitability is far above Ethereum&#8217;s.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Since November 2022 (FTX collapse), Bitcoin&#8217;s realized cap has grown by $468 billion (+117%), while Ethereum’s increased by just $61 billion (+32%). Bitcoin investors have held consistently larger unrealized profits than #Ethereum holders since January 2023. BTC investor profitability has exceeded ETH for 812 consecutive days &#8211; an all-time record,&#8221; Glassnode said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Glassnode came to these conclusions by analyzing both tokens&#8217; MVRV and their <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-read-crypto-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ratio of market value to realized value</a>. This metric compares the listed price of Bitcoin and Ethereum to the actual price at which these tokens were most recently traded. </p>



<p>Despite maintaining similar MVRVs for a prolonged period, Bitcoin is plowing well ahead today:</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2400" height="1350" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84.png" alt="Bitcoin and Ethereum MVRV" class="wp-image-685852" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84.png 2400w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84-850x478.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84-768x432.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84-1536x864.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/image-84-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2400px) 100vw, 2400px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin and Ethereum MVRV.

<p>While Bitcoin has been more volatile than Ethereum, the altcoin has seen a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/eth-btc-ratio-plummets-to-5-year-low/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">much smaller uptick during bullish cycles</a>. For instance, in the latest bull run between October and December 2024, Bitcoin surged by nearly 70%. </p>



<p>In the same period, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum&#8217;s price</a> increase was less than 50%. Yet, if we look at the drop during the current market downturn, BTC lost 3% in the first week of April, while ETH lost over 15%. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the altcoin&#8217;s investor sentiment is also dropping. Major whales who HODL&#8217;ed the token for many years are now selling their ETH holdings. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Another <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Ethereum?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Ethereum</a> OG starts dumping <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> after 3 years of dormancy!<br><br>He has sold 7,974 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a>($11.8M) at $1,479 over the past 2 hours and still holds 30,606 <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%24ETH&amp;src=ctag&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">$ETH</a> ($45.7M).<a href="https://t.co/Le4ViWn6OW">https://t.co/Le4ViWn6OW</a> <a href="https://t.co/WtRwPHQfqu">pic.twitter.com/WtRwPHQfqu</a></p>&mdash; Lookonchain (@lookonchain) <a href="https://twitter.com/lookonchain/status/1910362984939130886?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 10, 2025</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Also, the average Bitcoin holder enjoys an MVRV of around 2.0, meaning that they have huge unrealized gains. Most of their counterparts have an MVRV below 1.0, signifying that they have lost money. These data points are concerning, especially for the median ETH holder. </p>



<p>However, there&#8217;s a silver lining. Ethereum recently fell to a yearly low, but there&#8217;s also a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-marks-yearly-low/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strong uptick of new investors</a>. New developments, like the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-approves-ethereum-etf-options-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC approving ETH ETF options trading</a>, could spur a recovery. </p>



<p>In other words, Ethereum may be highly undervalued and, therefore, an attractive investment.</p>



<p>Still, for the time being, Bitcoin holders are in a much better position than ETH holders. Ethereum is still the second-largest cryptoasset by market cap, and it can always make a comeback. This will almost certainly pose a significant challenge.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Florida&#8217;s Insurance and Banking Subcommittee unanimously passed a bill supporting a state-level Bitcoin Reserve. It will now head to the legislature. This is the first state Bitcoin reserve bill to pass the House committee with zero votes against it. </strong></p>



<p>Although most of the initial comments were highly skeptical due to recent market chaos and fiscal conservatism, state sponsor Webster Barnaby and other supporters won them over.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-florida-advances-in-the-state-race-for-a-bitcoin-reserve">Florida Advances in the State Race for a Bitcoin Reserve</h2>



<p>Over the last few months, a <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-strategic-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spate of Bitcoin Reserve bills</a>&nbsp;has swept through US state legislatures. Although these initiatives&nbsp;<a href="https://beincrypto.com/republicans-disagreement-could-spoil-bitcoin-reserve-bills/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">have seen setbacks</a>&nbsp;due to&nbsp;<a href="https://beincrypto.com/american-voters-oppose-trump-bitcoin-reserve/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">funding concerns</a>, they have also had</span> noteworthy successes. </p>



<p>Today, the US crypto industry can count on another win, as Florida&#8217;s Insurance and Banking Subcommittee <a href="https://x.com/itzjoshuajake/status/1910345485715460406" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">unanimously</a> voted to approve a Bitcoin Reserve:</p>

</blockquote>



<p>Florida&#8217;s Bitcoin Reserve bill also marks a new milestone, even if it&#8217;s only a Subcommittee vote. This bill passed with complete bipartisan support, without a single Democrat siding against the bill. </p>



<p>One of the Representatives either abstained or was absent, but everyone present was swayed by the argument.</p>



<p>The bill proposes that the Flordia state government invest $1.5 billion in public funds to build a strategic BTC reserve. </p>



<p>Although the Subcommittee hearing was initially skeptical, partially due to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent tariff-imposed chaos</a>, sponsor Webster Barnaby maintained an impassioned defense. </p>

</div></figure>



<p>By the end, he and the Bitcoin Reserve bill&#8217;s other supporters had wholly won over this Florida Subcommittee. From here, it will head to the legislature. </p>



<p>Over 30 states have proposed reserve bills so far. Arizona is currently leading the race, with both of its Bitcoin bills reaching the final stage and waiting for a decision from the Senate. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson believes that Bitcoin can reach $250,000 by the end of the year. He thinks that tariffs are already priced in and future annoucements will be a &#8216;dud&#8217; for the crypto market. </strong></p>



<p>In the short term, he claimed that crypto markets will stall for three to five months as TradFi finds a new normal. Afterward, Bitcoin&#8217;s ability to transcend borders will give it a leg up over trade organizations and legacy banks. </p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-why-is-hoskinson-betting-on-bitcoin">Why Is Hoskinson Betting on Bitcoin?</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The threat of Trump&#8217;s tariffs</a> has caused a lot of turmoil in the crypto markets lately. The crypto market was always volatile, but the on-and-off tariffs introduced a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-crashes-below-75k-us-china-tariff-war-escalates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new level of chaotic volatility</a> for digital assets. </p>



<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/charles-hoskinson-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cardano founder Charles Hoskinson</a> is staking out a bold claim, <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/10/bitcoin-to-hit-250000-mag-7-adopt-stablecoins-charles-hoskinson.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stating</a> that Bitcoin could rise to $250,000:</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Crypto benefits in the long term. Your only option for globalization is crypto. If you want to business with countries the US, Russia, [or] China doesn&#8217;t like&#8230; you can no longer do that through trade organizations or legacy banks. You can only do that through crypto. I think Bitcoin will be over $250,000 by the end of this year or next year,&#8221; Hoskinson predicted.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Essentially, Hoskinson&#8217;s bullish case for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin&#8217;s price gains</a> is tied to the industry&#8217;s roots, which are decentralization and anonymity. Bitcoin was created in the aftermath of the 2008 crash, and it was intended to circumvent the often unfair overreach of traditional financial institutions. </p>



<p>If Trump&#8217;s tariffs lead to a breakdown in the global system of trade, Bitcoin could fill that void.</p>



<p>Naturally, Bitcoin already has a major use case in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/russia-bitcoin-trade-sanctions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helping countries avoid US sanctions</a>, but that doesn&#8217;t represent the entirety of Hoskinson&#8217;s argument. Ironically, in the short term, he believes that the tariffs will be a &#8220;dud.&#8221; </p>



<p>The Cardano founder thinks that markets will adjust to the new state of affairs, pouring cheap money into crypto. US stablecoin regulation will also help this process.</p>



<p>However, these short-term gains are just one piece of the puzzle. Hoskinson believes that tariffs, the Russo-Ukraine War, and other factors are all major contributors to this global breakdown that will help Bitcoin. </p>



<p>Crypto is currently more well-integrated into TradFi than ever, making it vulnerable to a wide array of macroeconomic concerns.</p>



<p>The industry is also gaining users quickly, with the total number of holders increasing 13% year over year. Bitcoin&#8217;s user base can take advantage of what Hoskinson calls &#8220;a huge wave of speculative interest&#8221; towards the end of the year. </p>



<p>The asset&#8217;s international positioning will keep it from being too reliant on this speculation forever.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>On April 10, 2025, the Chinese yuan (CNY) hit its lowest level in 18 years against the US dollar (USD) amid escalating tensions in the ongoing trade war between the two global economic giants. </strong></p>



<p>This significant milestone in China&#8217;s monetary policy has sparked renewed discussions about its implications for the cryptocurrency market—particularly Bitcoin (BTC).</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-cny-devaluation-amid-us-china-trade-war">CNY Devaluation Amid US-China Trade War</h2>



<p>One must first consider the broader economic context to understand the CNY devaluation. China is under heavy pressure from a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-market-surges-trump-pauses-tariffs-except-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trade war</a> with the United States, especially after the US imposed a sweeping <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trump-china-tariffs-crypto-stocks-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">104% tariff</a> on Chinese goods. </p>



<p>In retaliation, China introduced <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-crashes-below-75k-us-china-tariff-war-escalates/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an 84% tariff</a> on imports from the US. These measures have intensified economic friction between the two nations and placed the Chinese currency in a downward spiral.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2106" height="1238" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/usd-cny-rate.png" alt="USD/CNY rate.

Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/chart/?symbol=FX_IDC%3AUSDCNY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to data from TradingView, the USD/CNY reference rate currently sits at 7.3412. Historical data shows that the yuan has fallen to its <a href="https://x.com/WatcherGuru/status/1910148120228343829" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lowest point since 2007</a>. This suggests that China may intentionally loosen monetary controls to support its export-driven economy as it grapples with slowing growth.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-a-bullish-signal-for-bitcoin-and-the-crypto-market">A Bullish Signal for Bitcoin and the Crypto Market</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-tariff-war-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arthur Hayes</a>, co-founder of BitMEX, highlighted the potential link between the CNY devaluation and Bitcoin’s rise in a recent post on X (formerly Twitter). Hayes noted similar patterns in 2013 and 2015 when Chinese investors turned to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin</a> as a haven. He predicts a repeat in 2025 as investors seek to shield their wealth from the falling yuan.</p>

<p>“CNY deval = narrative that Chinese capital flight will flow into $BTC,” Hayes <a href="https://x.com/cburniske/status/1263913215706066944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">remarked</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In 2013, during stringent financial controls in China, Bitcoin emerged as an attractive alternative asset.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I think the Chinese really look to bitcoin as an excellent digital store of value, sort of like the new electronic version of gold.” <a href="https://www.wired.com/2013/10/btc-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a> Bobby Lee, CEO of BTC China.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This tendency became even more pronounced due to China’s strict capital control measures. These measures limit individuals from transferring just $50,000 abroad annually. As the yuan depreciates, Chinese citizens see their domestic purchasing power decline, prompting them to seek alternative stores of value. </p>



<p>With its decentralized nature and independence from government control, Bitcoin has become an appealing option.</p>



<p>In 2017, when China tightened capital controls and banned domestic cryptocurrency exchanges, Forbes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/leonhardweese/2017/11/29/bitcoin-regulation-in-china-still-unclear-but-chinese-exchanges-thrive-overseas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a> that Chinese investors flocked to Bitcoin to bypass these restrictions. This surge in demand pushed trading volume on platforms like Huobi (HTX) and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/okx-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OKX</a> to record highs. </p>



<p>At one point, these Chinese exchanges accounted for more than 90% of global Bitcoin trading volume. However, as the CNY strengthened, Bitcoin prices fell.</p>



<p>In 2020, the weakening of the yuan again drew analysts&#8217; attention. Chris Burniske, a well-known voice in the crypto space, <a href="https://x.com/cburniske/status/1263913215706066944" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">predicted</a> that a weaker yuan could drive Bitcoin prices higher—mirroring patterns observed in 2015 and 2016. He emphasized that if the CNY continues to fall against the USD, Bitcoin could enter another strong growth phase.</p>



<p>The yuan’s plunge to an 18-year low in 2025 could signal another bullish cycle for Bitcoin. First, strict capital controls remain, limiting Chinese investors’ ability to move wealth overseas. This restriction makes Bitcoin a viable option for capital preservation. </p>



<p>Second, historical patterns reinforce the view that a weakening CNY often coincides with Bitcoin’s upward momentum.</p>



<p>Finally, global market sentiment could shift as investors anticipate capital outflows from China entering Bitcoin, further fueling price gains. As the world watches China&#8217;s monetary decisions closely, Bitcoin stands poised to benefit as a hedge against devaluation and a global store of value in uncertain times.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>While rumors swirl about Strategy being forced to sell Bitcoin to cover losses, recent stock rallies suggest immediate concerns are overblown. However, the risk of forced liquidation remains if BTC continues to decline.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/strategy-bitcoin-sell-rumors-explained/">MicroStrategy Bitcoin Sale Rumors Explained: Risk Disclosure or Real Concern?</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Rumors have been circulating that Strategy will be forced to liquidate its Bitcoin reserves if the price keeps dropping. The specific fears have been overstated, but the fundamental idea might be essentially true. </strong></p>



<p>In any event, both Bitcoin and the firm&#8217;s stock price rose substantially after Trump announced a tariff pause. The immediate danger of a selloff has seemingly passed, but these factors may come into play in the future.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-will-strategy-need-to-sell-its-bitcoin">Will Strategy Need to Sell Its Bitcoin?</h2>



<p>Since Strategy (<a href="https://beincrypto.com/microstrategy-rebrands-to-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">formerly MicroStrategy</a>) started buying Bitcoin, it&#8217;s become <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/who-owns-the-most-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of the world&#8217;s largest holders</a> and a major pillar of market confidence. </p>



<p>While this has financially strengthened the company, it also presents certain challenges. Being one of the largest holders, if Michael Saylor&#8217;s firm chooses to sell a portion of its holdings, it could impact BTC&#8217;s market performance. </p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/BlockchainCult/status/1909794944446800274" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rumors</a> have been circulating that such an event might be inevitable, based on a recent filing. In the SEC filings, the firm writes a disclaimer that without access to favorable equity or debt financing, it could be required to liquidate BTC at a loss. </p>



<p>While the statement exists, it’s not new or extraordinary; it’s a routine inclusion found in MicroStrategy’s previous 10-Q reports from Q1 2024 and prior years.</p>



<p>BeInCrypto <a href="https://beincrypto.com/strategy-pauses-bitcoin-buys-during-market-turmoil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported on Strategy&#8217;s Form 8-K</a> when it came out earlier this week, analyzing its implications. The form claimed that Strategy did not buy any Bitcoin last week and has over $5.91 billion in unrealized losses.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We may be required to take actions to pay expenses, such as selling bitcoin or using proceeds from equity or debt financings, some of which could cause significant variation in operating results in any quarter,&#8221; Strategy&#8217;s SEC <a href="https://assets.contentstack.io/v3/assets/bltf8d808d9b8cebd37/blt941a23a55f18d2b0/67f2f722e78a92adc130dcaf/form-8-k_04-07-2025.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filing</a> claimed.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>During <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/us-recession-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent market chaos</a>, these unrealized losses caused a lot of distress in the crypto community. However, that doesn&#8217;t mean that Strategy will have to dump its Bitcoin soon. In any event, its stock rallied today <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-market-surges-trump-pauses-tariffs-except-china/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">because of Trump&#8217;s tariff pause</a>.</p>

<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-a-few-credible-selloff-scenarios">A Few Credible Selloff Scenarios</h2>



<p>Although these concerns lack nuance, that doesn&#8217;t mean they&#8217;re totally unfounded. Michael Saylor <a href="https://x.com/Bitcoin_Teddy/status/1893821547841773871" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">claimed</a> that Strategy can pay off its debts even if Bitcoin crashes, but some community members think these claims are either <a href="https://x.com/TardFiWhale/status/1894099546604458174#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">incorrect</a> or deliberate <a href="https://x.com/his_eminence_j/status/1894109762230653213#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lies</a>. </p>



<p>His stated plan would involve massively diluting stock when <a href="https://beincrypto.com/strategy-bitcoin-financial-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he has already sold huge volumes</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, several scenarios could force Strategy to sell its Bitcoin. If its price were to fall significantly and stay low, Strategy&#8217;s ability to meet debt obligations without tapping its BTC treasury could become strained. </p>



<p>The firm&#8217;s low revenue from its non-BTC business ventures would further exacerbate this problem.</p>



<p>Additionally, Strategy has used Bitcoin as collateral for loans on several occasions. If BTC drops below collateral thresholds, margin calls could force partial liquidation. However, such scenarios would be outlined in specific loan agreements, not general filings.</p>



<p>Above all else, the appearance of forced selling can seriously impact market sentiment, which is why these rumors are so serious. </p>



<p>Strategy&#8217;s stock price and Bitcoin are both riding high right now, and selloff fears seem less imminent. Yet, the fundamental macroeconomic situation remains unchanged. If Bitcoin falls again, MSTR&#8217;s debt position in the market will likely be impacted. </p>

<p><strong>Bitcoin additions to corporate treasuries have risen during the first quarter of 2025, with industry giants like Tether and Metaplanet reaching record allocations compared to the previous quarter.</strong></p>



<p>However, recent trade policy announcements in the US have cast a shadow over further Bitcoin accumulation. BeInCrypto spoke with representatives from CoinShares, Bitget, Brickken, and IntoTheBlock to explore the sustainability of this trend throughout the year and the likelihood of further corporate adoption.</p>

<p>As Bitcoin&#8217;s path to mainstream adoption gains momentum, more companies are either expanding their BTC holdings or allocating the asset to their corporate treasuries for the first time in 2025.</p>

<p>“Moving‬‭ Bitcoin‬‭ onto‬‭ corporate‬‭ balance‬‭ sheets‬‭ indicates‬‭ growing‬‭ acceptance‬‭ beyond‬‭ just‬‭ speculative‬‭ trading.‬‭ It‬‭ reflects‬‭ an‬‭ increasing‬‭ view‬‭ of‬‭ Bitcoin‬‭ as‬‭ a‬‭ legitimate‬‭ treasury‬‭ reserve‬‭ asset‬‭ and‬‭ a‬‭ potential‬‭ long-term‬‭ store‬‭ of‬‭ value‬‭ for‬‭ institutions.‬‭ This‬‭ marks a maturation into a legitimate asset class,” Juan Pellicer, Senior Research Analyst at IntoTheBlock, told BeInCrypto.</p>

<p>The first quarter of 2025 stood out, with several major industry players making their largest Bitcoin allocations. Tether, the world’s largest stablecoin issuer, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/tether-sell-bitcoin-stablecoin-regulation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gradually acquired 8,888 BTC since January</a>, bringing its total BTC balance to over 100,000. In the previous quarter, the issuer had only added 1,035 to its reserve.</p>



<p>Metaplanet also increased its allocation efforts. The Japanese publicly traded company first started purchasing Bitcoin in May 2024. By December, Metaplanet had accumulated 1,762 BTC, which grew to 4,046 by March 2025.</p>



<p>While other high-profile companies did not break their previous allocation records, they significantly expanded their Bitcoin supply.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-expanding-the-ranks-from-microstrategy-to-gamestop"><strong>Expanding the Ranks: From MicroStrategy to GameStop</strong></h2>



<p>Strategy, formerly known as MicroStrategy, has maintained its consistency with its aggressive accumulation style. So far this year, the company has bought a whopping 53,396 BTC.</p>

<p>“‬Many firms are also drawing inspiration from Michael Saylor’s high-profile Bitcoin strategy since‬‭ August 2020. Its success has set a precedent, showing how a bold allocation to Bitcoin can‬‭ serve as both a hedge and a long-term growth asset,” Bitget CEO Gracy Chen explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fold Holdings, for example, has only recently begun acquiring Bitcoin. In early March, the financial services company publicly announced that it had bought 475 BTC, bringing its total accumulation to 1,485.</p>



<p>Corporations outside Web3 are also now joining the trend of acquiring Bitcoin. </p>



<p>Two weeks ago, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/why-gamestop-bitcoin-announcement-left-btc-unmoved/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">video game and electronics retailer GameStop</a> announced an update to its investment policy, revealing the addition of Bitcoin as a treasury reserve asset. Although the company made no immediate commitment to purchase BTC, speculation is high that it will allocate a portion of its $4.8 billion cash balance to the cryptocurrency.</p>

<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-factors-driving-corporate-bitcoin-adoption"><strong>Factors Driving Corporate Bitcoin Adoption</strong></h2>



<p>Bitcoin has become increasingly appealing to investors looking for an asset to hedge against inflation. Given BTC’s self-limiting supply, it is not subject to the type of depreciation that can impact fiat currencies.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;The combination of digital innovation and finite supply, with only 21 million coins ever to exist,‬ positions Bitcoin as a modern equivalent of digital gold,” Chen told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to Max Shannon, an analyst at CoinShares, this may have led Metaplanet to accumulate record amounts of Bitcoin during the first three months of 2025. Metaplanet has already <a href="https://beincrypto.com/metaplanet-aims-to-acquire-10000-btc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced plans to amass 10,000 BTC by the end of the year</a>.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“For‬‭ Japanese‬‭ firms‬‭ facing‬‭ persistent‬‭ yen‬‭ depreciation,‬‭ Bitcoin‬‭ serves‬‭ as‬‭ a‬‭ hard-asset‬‭ hedge.‬‭ Moreover,‬‭ in‬‭ markets‬‭ with‬‭ negative‬‭ real‬‭ yields,‬‭ BTC‬‭ offers‬‭ superior‬‭ long-term‬‭ risk-adjusted‬‭ returns.‬‭ Although‬‭ it‬‭ has‬‭ no‬‭ yield‬‭ it‬‭ offers‬‭ long-term‬‭ upside‬‭ and‬‭ inflation‬‭ resistance‬‭ when‬‭ the‬‭ inflation rates‬‭ (either‬‭ prices‬‭ paid or monetary inflation) are higher than the nominal interest rate,” he said. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given heightened concerns over spikes in inflation in the United States, Bitcoin has also become more appealing among American investors. Changes in accounting for digital currencies have also made them a more attractive addition to investment portfolios.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-the-appeal-of-new-accounting-standards"><strong>The Appeal of New Accounting Standards</strong></h2>



<p>In addition to its perceived value as an inflation hedge, Bitcoin&#8217;s attractiveness as a corporate investment has been further amplified by recent modifications to accounting standards in the United States.</p>



<p>In January, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fasb-accounting-rules-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Financial‬‭ Accounting‬‭ Standards‬‭ Board‬‭ (FASB)</a> issued a new rule that enabled companies‬‭ with‬‭ BTC‬‭ in‬‭ their‬‭ treasuries‬‭‬‭ to‬‭ report‬‭ the‬‭ profits‬‭ on‬‭ unrealized‬‭ gains‬‭ from‬‭ their‬‭ digital‬‭ assets. Instead of waiting until they have sold their assets, companies can now report that increase in value as income in their financial statements.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“‭Selling‬‭ a‬‭ depreciating‬‭ fiat‬‭ currency‬‭ in‬‭ return‬‭ for‬‭ a‬‭ digital‬‭ hard‬‭ asset‬‭ such‬‭ as‬‭ Bitcoin‬‭ that‬‭ is‬‭ also‬‭ liquid‬‭ and‬‭ a‬‭ &#8216;cash‬‭ equivalent&#8217;‬‭ that‬‭ can‬‭ benefit‬‭ from‬‭ the‬‭ new‬‭ FASB‬‭ accounting‬‭ treatment‬‭ (which‬‭ can‬‭ also‬‭ improve‬‭ the‬‭ income‬‭ statement)‬‭ makes‬‭ Bitcoin‬‭ an‬‭ attractive‬‭ treasury asset,” Shannon added.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite its potential for inflation stability, Bitcoin&#8217;s inherent volatility can also attract investors with a greater risk appetite and companies aiming to diversify their holdings.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-can-bitcoin-s-volatility-be-a-strategic-advantage"><strong>Can Bitcoin&#8217;s Volatility Be a Strategic Advantage?</strong></h2>



<p>Beta measures a stock&#8217;s volatility relative to the overall market. The higher the beta, the more volatile the stock is. </p>



<p>According to Shannon, adding a volatile asset like Bitcoin to the balance sheet increases the beta of the equity. If the price of Bitcoin goes up, the overall investor portfolio can score big.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“This‬‭ can‬‭ enhance‬‭ returns‬‭ for‬‭ investors‬‭ and‬‭ has‬‭ proven‬‭ to‬‭ do‬‭ so.‬‭ The‬‭ volatility‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ equity‬‭ also‬‭ tends‬‭ to‬‭ increase‬‭ which‬‭ improves‬‭ the‬‭ interest‬‭ rate‬‭ on‬‭ convertible‬‭ debt,‬‭ therefore,‬‭ impacting‬‭ the‬‭ capital‬‭ structure‬‭ and‬‭ cost‬‭ of‬‭ capital‬‭ for‬‭ the‬‭ company.‬‭ The‬‭ volatility‬‭ also‬‭ gives‬‭ way‬‭ for‬‭ option‬‭ and‬‭ derivative‬‭ traders‬‭ which‬‭ can‬‭ increase‬‭ the‬‭ volumes‬‭ of the stock and make it a more liquid asset,” Shannon told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Strategy serves as an example of these added benefits. Since the company started accumulating Bitcoin in 2020, it has made significant capital gains.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“[Strategy’s] Bitcoin strategy has led to significant returns. For most firms that acquired Bitcoin‬ prior to the inauguration of President Donald Trump, current market prices have significantly exceeded their original entry points, resulting in notable capital gains. This price appreciation‬‭ remains one of the primary incentives for companies to hold Bitcoin in their treasuries,” Chen explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/metaplanet-bitcoin-investment-losses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investors can face higher potential losses</a> during a Bitcoin bear market. Because of this, BTC as a treasury asset may be more appealing to companies looking to diversify or firms large enough to weather the storm.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-for-specific-business-cases"><strong>Bitcoin for Specific Business Cases</strong></h2>



<p>The volatility and heightened trading activity accompanying Bitcoin adoption might offer a strategic advantage to particular companies, notably <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-lifeline-struggling-companies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">those with performance issues</a> or in highly competitive sectors.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Underperforming‬‭ or‬‭ mature‬‭ businesses‬‭ in‬‭ competitive‬‭ markets‬‭ would‬‭ benefit‬‭ from‬‭ an‬‭ asset‬‭ that‬‭ increases‬‭ the‬‭ volatilty‬‭ and‬‭ volumes,‬‭ as‬‭ well‬‭ as‬‭ the‬‭ beta‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ equity,” Shannon told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>To that point, Pellicer added:</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Beyond‬‭ diversification,‬‭ holding‬‭ Bitcoin‬‭ might‬‭ be‬‭ seen‬‭ as‬‭ a‬‭ strategic‬‭ move‬‭ to‬‭ gain‬‭ exposure‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ potential‬‭ upside‬‭ of‬‭ a‬‭ growing‬‭ asset‬‭ class.‬‭ It‬‭ reflects‬‭ a‬‭ fundamental‬‭ belief‬‭ in‬‭ Bitcoin&#8217;s‬‭ long-term‬‭ value‬‭ proposition‬‭ as‬‭ a‬‭ hedge‬‭ against‬‭ monetary‬‭ debasement.‬‭ It‬‭ also‬‭ signals‬‭ a‬‭ strategic‬‭ positioning in a pro-crypto political climate (Trump’s policies).‬”‭</p>
</blockquote>



<p>GameStop is a good example of the former. The retailer’s Q4 2024 earnings report <a href="https://beincrypto.com/gamestop-to-buy-bitcoin-after-earnings-report/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showed a significant decline in its sales volume</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the worrying financial report, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/gamestop-bitcoin-purchase-stock-surges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop’s stock value rose by 12%</a> after signaling that it would add BTC as a treasury reserve asset. Limited crypto exposure is expected to strengthen the company’s financial position in 2025.</p>



<p>In turn, Tether&#8217;s perceived robustness could make it more capable of withstanding Bitcoin&#8217;s significant price volatility.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-leveraging-profits-for-bitcoin-tether-s-financial-strategy"><strong>Leveraging Profits for Bitcoin: Tether&#8217;s Financial Strategy</strong></h2>



<p>As the issuer of the largest stablecoin, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/best-usdt-wallet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tether</a> generates substantial revenue from transaction fees and managing its vast reserves. This financial strength could provide a buffer to absorb potential losses from Bitcoin price drops.</p>



<p>Demonstrating this financial capacity, Tether allocates 15% of its quarterly net profits to Bitcoin.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“This‬‭ is‬‭ similar‬‭ to‬‭ Dollar‬‭ Cost‬‭ Averaging‬‭ by‬‭ allocating‬‭ 15%‬‭ of‬‭ its‬‭ net‬‭ realized‬‭ operating‬‭ profits‬‭ for‬‭ Bitcoin.‬‭ This‬‭ is‬‭ a‬‭ relatively‬‭ conservative‬‭ approach‬‭ because‬‭ it‬‭ is‬‭ post-tax‬‭ so‬‭ the‬‭ excess‬‭ cash‬‭ (retained‬‭ earnings)‬‭ that‬‭ accrues‬‭ to‬‭ equity‬‭ can‬‭ be‬‭ used‬‭ for‬‭ a‬‭ higher‬‭ growth‬‭ asset.‬‭ In‬‭ this‬‭ instance,‬‭ there‬‭ are‬‭ not‬‭ huge‬‭ drawbacks‬‭ because‬‭ the‬‭ company‬‭ is‬‭ well‬‭ capitalised‬‭ with‬‭ $7 billion‬‭ in‬‭ net‬‭ equity,‬‭ so‬‭ its‬‭ prudent‬‭ risk‬‭ management.‬‭ However,‬‭ there‬‭ are‬‭ still‬‭ <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/black-swan-meaning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">black‬‭ swans</a>‬‭ where‬‭ cash‬‭ would‬‭ be‬‭ better needed than Bitcoin,” Shannon explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite its inherent unpredictability, Bitcoin&#8217;s observed long-term decline in volatility over recent years has supported the rationale for including it –even in small amounts– within a well-diversified portfolio.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Bitcoin‬‭ has‬‭ improved‬‭ the‬‭ risk-adjusted‬‭ returns‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ 60/40‬‭ portfolio‬‭ since‬‭ 2017.‬‭ [It] still‬‭ has‬‭ volatility‬‭ risk‬‭ which‬‭ companies‬‭ may‬‭ not‬‭ be‬‭ willing‬‭ to‬‭ absorb,‬‭ however,‬‭ the‬‭ volatility has historically trended down and could continue this into the future,” Shannon added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While acknowledging Bitcoin&#8217;s advantages, Shannon finds it increasingly challenging to foresee if corporate asset accumulation will maintain the same rapid pace in Q2 as it did at the beginning of the year.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-market-disruptions-will-corporate-appetite-wane"><strong>Market Disruptions: Will Corporate Appetite Wane?</strong></h2>



<p>Though only in its second week, April has proven to be a hard month for financial markets. The cryptocurrency sector <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-recovery-trump-liberation-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">experienced the most pronounced impact</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-crypto-mining-trump-liberation-day-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trump’s recent Liberation Day celebration</a> sent stocks on a downward spiral as investors braced themselves for incoming uncertainty.

<p>Amid this new wave of anxiety, Shannon anticipates that companies will prioritize more pressing concerns over further Bitcoin accumulation.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The‬‭ longer-term‬‭ trend‬‭ points‬‭ to‬‭ further‬‭ balance‬‭ sheet‬‭ accumulation,‬‭ however,‬‭ its‬‭ hard‬‭ to‬‭ call‬‭ quarter‬‭ over‬‭ quarter.‬‭ Based‬‭ on‬‭ the‬‭ current‬‭ volality‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ markets,‬‭ and‬‭ <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tariff‬‭ implications</a>‬‭ on‬‭ margins,‬‭ I‬‭ suspect‬‭ operational‬‭ issues‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ front‬‭ of‬‭ mind‬‭ rather than Bitcoin accumulation,” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>However, current corporate interest in Bitcoin could lead other companies to follow their lead.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-beyond-speculative-trading"><strong>Beyond Speculative Trading</strong></h2>



<p>According to Brickken market analyst Emmanuel Cardozo, Bitcoin allocation efforts will continue throughout the second quarter of 2025.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“I’d say we’re likely to see a similar, if not faster, pace of Bitcoin accumulation in Q2 2025 from companies like Strategy, Metaplanet, and Tether. Strategy’s been a consistent buyer, adding to‬‭ their holdings regularly, and I don’t see them stopping,” he explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In Tether’s particular case, whether the company decides to increase or decrease the percentage of revenue it invests in further Bitcoin purchases will depend on how well USDT will perform.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“‬Tether’s profit allocation strategy means their buys will depend on how USDT performs, but with‬‭ stablecoin demand growing, they’ll probably keep adding at a steady pace considering the‬ ‭ pro-crypto policies possibly coming from Trump’s administration,” Cardozo added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite current uncertainties over the US’s trade policies, he believes more corporations will pursue Bitcoin as a treasury asset.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“This corporate adoption wave signals a real shift in how institutional investors see‬‭ Bitcoin. It’s not just a speculative play anymore, but rather treating it like a serious asset to hold‬‭ long-term.‬ It’s a sign Bitcoin’s moving‬‭ from a niche investment to a mainstream part of corporate finance, and I think we’ll see more‬‭ institutions follow suit as they get comfortable with the idea of Bitcoin as a core piece of their‬‭ strategy,” Cardozo concluded.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ultimately, the decision about whether Bitcoin meaningfully improves treasury performance during economic turmoil will depend on each company&#8217;s specific circumstances.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-an-uncertain-future"><strong>An Uncertain Future</strong></h2>



<p>Corporate Bitcoin accumulation has reached new heights during the first quarter of 2025, but recent political and economic developments can either stump or further accelerate future advancements.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bitcoin’s price responded violently to Trump’s Liberation Day announcements, dropping below $75,000. While corporations that have already added Bitcoin as a treasury asset may be confident in the cryptocurrency’s long-term benefits, other companies may take a more conservative approach.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Until the future of global trade relations becomes clearer, these circumstances may dampen short-term accumulation for newer corporations. Those confident in Bitcoin’s promise as a long-term store of value are already getting a headstart.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Bitcoin sharply fell on Wednesday as China raised tariffs on all US imports from 34% to 84%. Bitcoin price was down nearly 5% on the 24-hour chart at press time. The development comes as global financial markets are sinking under pressure from the US imposing a 104% tariff on Chinese imports. </strong></p>



<p>The sell-off coincided with mounting fears that escalating trade tensions between the world’s two largest economies could derail global economic recovery.<br></p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-crashes-as-stock-market-bleeds-worldwide">Bitcoin Crashes as Stock Market Bleeds Worldwide</h2>

<p><strong>Goldman Sachs has raised its probability of a US recession within the next year to 45%. The prediction signals increased economic uncertainty amid escalating global tensions, tightening financial conditions, and looming tariff impacts.</strong></p>



<p>This marks the highest probability of recession predicted by the investment bank since the post-pandemic inflation and interest rate hikes began.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-goldman-sachs-sees-45-chances-of-us-recession">Goldman Sachs Sees 45% Chances of US Recession</h2>



<p>Goldman Sachs’ latest note, &#8220;Countdown to Recession,&#8221; outlines a sharp deterioration in economic conditions. These include the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trump-tariffs-impact-bitcoin-mining/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">implications of tariffs</a> expected to take effect on April 9.</p>



<p>Steven Rattner, former head of the Obama Auto Task Force and current Wall Street financier, shared the news on social media, emphasizing the gravity of Goldman’s new outlook.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Goldman Sachs now predicts a 45% chance of a recession in the next year,&#8221; Rattner <a href="https://x.com/SteveRattner/status/1909281338047209532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wrote</a>.</p>

<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="645" height="625" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/fredgraph-2.png" alt="Goldman Sachs US recession probability.

Source: <a href="https://x.com/SteveRattner/status/1909281338047209532" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rattner on X</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>According to Rattner, the recent surge in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trump-china-tariffs-crypto-stocks-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">policy uncertainty</a> and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/stealth-quantitative-easing-fed-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">capital spending concerns</a> compound financial market instability.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Nick Timiraos, the chief economics correspondent for The Wall Street Journal, echoed the news, indicating the bank has adjusted its 2025 Q4 GDP growth forecast to a mere 0.5%.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“We are lowering our 2025 Q4/Q4 GDP growth forecast to 0.5% and raising our 12-month recession probability from 35% to 45% following a sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty that is likely to depress capital spending by more than we had previously assumed,” Timiraos <a href="https://x.com/NickTimiraos/status/1909065782249787721" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported</a>, citing Goldman Sachs.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While this reflects the anticipated fallout, the bank’s current forecast assumes that many <a href="https://beincrypto.com/trump-china-tariffs-crypto-stocks-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new tariffs scheduled for April 9</a> will not materialize.</p>



<p>However, Goldman Sachs articulated that if Trump enacted these tariffs, the bank would adjust its prediction and formally forecast a recession. This could fuel already simmering inflation and drive further downward pressure on US economic growth.</p>



<p>Amid escalating trade tensions, Polymarket bettors see almost 70% odds of US recession after Liberation Day tariffs.</p>

<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-goldman-sachs-ups-bitcoin-etf-holdings">Goldman Sachs Ups Bitcoin ETF Holdings</h2>



<p>Despite the grim outlook for the economy, Goldman Sachs remains heavily invested in the crypto space, particularly <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-bitcoin-in-four-easy-steps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin (BTC)</a>. As of February 12, the bank held a substantial $1.5 billion in Bitcoin. This exposure comes through exposure to BlackRock and Fidelity’s <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-bitcoin-etf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin ETFs</a> (exchange-traded funds).</p>



<p>Moreover, recent <a href="https://www.sec.gov/edgar/search/#/q=Bitcoin&amp;dateRange=custom&amp;entityName=Goldman&amp;startdt=2025-02-11&amp;enddt=2025-02-11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filings</a> reveal that Goldman Sachs has significantly increased its Bitcoin ETF holdings. <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Com</span>pared to previous filings, it boosted its position in the&nbsp;iShares Bitcoin Trust (IBIT)&nbsp;by 88% and the Franklin Bitcoin Trust (FBTC) by 105%.</p>



<p>This position reflects Goldman Sachs’ growing interest in digital assets as an alternative <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-big-leap-into-defi/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store of value</a> amid traditional market instability.</p>



<p>This increase comes as Bitcoin has shown resilience in recent months, outpacing many other asset classes in performance. Recently, the bank’s CEO, David Solomon, highlighted the potential of blockchain technology to streamline traditional finance (TradFi). BeInCrypto reported Solomon saying <a href="https://beincrypto.com/goldman-sachs-ceo-bitcoin-us-dollar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bitcoin was not a threat to the US dollar</a>.</p>



<p>Besides Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan also predicted a recession in the US. BeInCrypto reported that it was the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/5-us-economic-indicators-crypto-april/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first major Wall Street bank to predict a US recession</a> following former <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/trump-tariffs-crypto-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Trump’s tariffs</a>.</p>



<p>Their forecast warned of the broader economic consequences of trade wars, predicting that the Federal Reserve (Fed) might need to cut rates sooner than expected.</p>



<p>The possibility of a rate cut, which many see as a response to a weakening economy, adds to concerns about stagflation—a simultaneous rise in inflation and stagnation in economic growth.</p>



<p>This economic uncertainty also raises the odds of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/odds-of-quantitative-easing-crypto-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">quantitative easing (QE) in the US financial system</a>. Such an outcome could have far-reaching implications for the crypto market. </p>



<p>If the Fed opts for stealth QE, it could <a href="https://beincrypto.com/stealth-quantitative-easing-fed-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">inject liquidity into the market and provide a short-term lifeline</a> for risk assets like Bitcoin.</p>



<p>However, such actions could also intensify inflationary pressures, prompting a difficult balancing act for policymakers.</p>
