										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solana plunged to a 12-month low of $95.23 on April 7, marking a sharp decline amid broader market turbulence.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>However, as the market embarked on a recovery this week, SOL has witnessed a rebound, with its price climbing as demand surges.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-sol-rebounds-17-eyes-further-gains">SOL Rebounds 17%, Eyes Further Gains</h2>



<p>Since SOL began its current rally, its value has soared by 17%. At press time, the altcoin trades at $124.58, resting atop an ascending trend line.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-26-02.png" alt="

Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>This pattern emerges when the price of an asset consistently makes higher lows over a period of time. It represents an <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-rebounds-but-selling-pressure-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uptrend</a>, indicating that SOL demand is gradually increasing, driving its prices higher. It suggests that the coin buyers are willing to pay more, and it serves as a support level during price corrections.</p>



<p>SOL’s recovery is further supported by its rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating increasing buying interest. This momentum indicator is at 49.58 at press time, poised to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-sol-price-crashes-below-key-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break above</a> the 50-neutral line.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27.png" alt="SOL RSI" class="wp-image-686432" style="width:998px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SOL RSI. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The RSI indicator measures an asset’s overbought and oversold market conditions. It ranges between 0 and 100. Values above 70 suggest that the asset is overbought and due for a price decline, while values under 30 indicate that the asset is oversold and may witness a rebound.</p>



<p>At 49.50 and climbing, SOL’s RSI signals a steady shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. A rise above 50 would confirm increasing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying pressure</a> and a potential for a sustained upward price movement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-solana-bulls-eye-138">Solana Bulls Eye $138</h2>



<p>SOL’s ascending trend line forms a solid support floor below its price at $120.74. If demand soars and the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-price-rises-supply-distribution-hits-monthly-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullish presence</a> with the SOL spot markets strengthens, the coin could continue its rally and climb to $138.41.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23.png" alt="SOL Price Analysis" class="wp-image-686434" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SOL Price Analysis.

<p>However, if profit-taking commences, the support at $120.74 would be breached, and the SOL’s price could revisit $95.23.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Ethereum ETFs have closed yet another week in the red, recording net outflows amid continued investor hesitation.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Notably, there has been no single week of net inflows since the end of February, highlighting waning institutional interest in ETH-related products.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-etfs-face-steady-outflows">Ethereum ETFs Face Steady Outflows</h2>



<p>Ethereum-backed ETFs have recorded their seventh consecutive week of net outflows, highlighting <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-marks-yearly-low/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustained institutional</a> hesitance toward the asset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week alone, net outflows from spot ETH ETFs totaled $82.47 million, marking a 39% surge from the $49 million recorded in outflows the previous week.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2688" height="868" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04.png" alt="Total Ethereum Spot ETF Net Inflow" class="wp-image-686420" style="width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04.png 2688w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-360x116.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-850x274.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-768x248.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-1536x496.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-2048x661.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-150x48.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2688px) 100vw, 2688px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Total Ethereum Spot ETF Net Inflow.

<p>With the steady decline in institutional presence in the ETH market, the selling pressure on the coin has soared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past week, ETH’s price has declined by 11%. The steady outflows from the funds backed by the coin suggest that the downward momentum may persist, increasing the likelihood of a price drop below the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-solana-nokia-irrelevance-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1,500 mark.</a></p>



<p>On the price chart, technical indicators remain bearish, confirming the mounting pressure from the selling side of the market. For example, at press time, readings from ETH’s Directional Movement Index (DMI) show its positive directional index (+DI) resting below the negative directional index (-DI).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23.png" alt="" class="wp-image-686421" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH DMI. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The DMI indicator measures the strength of an asset’s price trend. It consists of two lines: the +DI, which represents upward <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price movement</a>, and the -DI, which represents downward price movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As with ETH, when the +DI rests below the -DI, the market is in a bearish trend, with downward price movement dominating the market sentiment.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-s-price-could-drop-below-1-500">Ethereum’s Price Could Drop Below $1,500</h2>



<p>The lack of institutional capital could delay any significant rebound in ETH price, further dampening short-term prospects for recovery. If demand leans further, ETH could break out of its narrow range and follow a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-eth-rallies-key-indicators-bearish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downward trend</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The altcoin could fall below $1,500 in this scenario to reach $1,395.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37.png" alt="ETH Price Analysis." class="wp-image-686422" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-38-37-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH Price Analysis.

<p>However, if ETH witnesses a positive shift in sentiment and demand spikes, its price could climb to $2,114.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Despite lingering market uncertainty fueled by Donald Trump’s escalating trade war, the cryptocurrency market showed signs of recovery this week.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>On-chain data reveals that crypto whales took advantage of the volatility to accumulate select altcoins, signaling growing confidence in specific digital assets.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-doge">Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>



<p>Leading <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/meme-coins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin</a> Dogecoin (DOGE) has received significant attention from crypto whales this week. This is reflected by the spike in the number of coins purchased over the past seven days by DOGE whale addresses that hold between 100 million and 1 billion coins. </p>



<p>According to data from Santiment, these DOGE holders have accumulated 1.41 billion coins worth over $220 million during the review period. As of press time, their total holdings have surged to 25.68 billion DOGE, marking the highest level since December last year.</p>

<p>When an asset’s large holders increase their accumulation like this, it suggests increased confidence or anticipation of future price gains. If this continues, DOGE could break above the resistance at $0.17 in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-price-long-liquidations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the near term</a> and climb toward $0.23.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-worldcoin-wld">Worldcoin (WLD)</h2>



<p>WLD is another altcoin that has caught whales’ attention this week. The Sam Altman-linked token currently trades at&nbsp; $0.74, shedding 1% of its value over the past week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During that period, whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 WLD have accumulated 2.63 million tokens valued above $1.94 million.</p>

<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ondo-ondo">Ondo (ONDO)</h2>



<p>The<strong> </strong><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/real-world-asset-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-world asset-based</a> (RWA) token ONDO is also on this week’s crypto whales’ list.

<p>This cohort of ONDO investors currently holds 702.37 million coins.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Leading coin Bitcoin has had a turbulent past few weeks, with its price troubles prompting many short-term investors—often referred to as &#8220;paper hands&#8221;—to exit the market.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>However, amidst the price volatility, the coin’s long-term holders (LTHs) remain resolute and show no signs of backing down as they attempt to push BTC back above $85,000. How soon can they realize this?</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-long-term-holders-shift-from-selling-to-stacking">Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Shift From Selling to Stacking</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/67f982c6b71f0960817db375-Are-Long-Term-Holders-Switching-from-Distribution-to-Accumulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci assessed BTC’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change (30d sum) and found that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-fails-to-secure-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since April 6</a>, the metric has turned positive, showing clear upward momentum. As a result, Kesmeci wrote, BTC has risen by approximately 12%. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1238" height="832" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59.png" alt="Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Change" class="wp-image-686400" style="width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59.png 1238w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-360x242.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-850x571.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-768x516.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-150x101.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1238px) 100vw, 1238px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Change. Source: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoQuant</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>BTC’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change tracks the buying and selling behavior of LTHs (those who have held their assets for at least 155 days)&nbsp;to measure the shift in the number of coins held by these investors over a specific period.</p>



<p>When its value is positive, it indicates that LTHs are not selling, and remain optimistic about BTC’s future price performance. Conversely, when it turns negative, it suggests that these holders are selling or distributing their coins, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-stalls-whales-stay-sidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often in response</a> to market pressures, which is a bearish signal.</p>



<p>According to Kesmeci, BTC’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change (30d sum) flipping positive is notable. This metric had remained below zero since October last week, signaling that LTHs were consistently selling their BTCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sellofs reached their lowest point on December 5, prompting a 32% dip in BTC’s price and marking the peak of a 6-month period of distribution by LTHs.</p>



<p>However, this trend has changed since April 6. The metric now sits above zero and is in an uptrend. Speaking on what this means, Kemesci added:</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“While it’s too early to say definitively, the growing positive momentum in this metric could be a sign that long-term conviction is returning to the market.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moreover, BTC’s funding rate has remained positive amid its price troubles, confirming the bullish outlook above. At press time, this is at 0.0037%.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2832" height="804" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50.png" alt="" class="wp-image-686401" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50.png 2832w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-360x102.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-850x241.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-768x218.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-1536x436.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-2048x581.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-150x43.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2832px) 100vw, 2832px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTC Funding Rate. Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coinglass</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The funding rate is the periodic payment exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures markets. It is designed to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-decline-miners-join-selloff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep the futures</a> price close to the underlying asset&#8217;s spot price.</p>



<p>When it is positive like this, long traders are paying short traders. This indicates a bullish market sentiment, as more traders are betting on BTC’s price to climb.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-long-term-holders-set-the-stage-for-87-000-run">Long-Term Holders Set the Stage for $87,000 Run</h2>



<p>The surge in accumulation from BTC LTHs has pushed the coin’s price above the key resistance at $81,863. At press time, the king coin trades at $83,665.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market responds to these sustained buying pressures from LTHs, the coin’s price may be primed for a significant rally in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If retail traders follow suit and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase their</a> coin demand, BTC could break above $85,000 to $87,730.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, if the accumulation trend ends and these LTHs begin to sell for gains, BTC could resume its decline, fall below $81,863, and drop toward $74,389.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Crypto whales are making bold moves following Donald Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, with Ethereum (ETH), Mantra (OM), and Onyxcoin (XCN) drawing significant accumulation. </strong></p>



<p>ETH whales pushed holdings to their highest level since September 2023, while OM holders are quietly increasing exposure amid the growing real-world asset narrative. XCN, meanwhile, saw a sharp spike in whale activity alongside a 50% price surge in just 24 hours.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-eth">Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p>The broader <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bullish-altcoins-trumps-tariff-pause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto market rallied after Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs</a>—excluding China—boosting investor sentiment across risk assets. </p>



<p>Ethereum followed suit, with on-chain data showing a rise in crypto whales activity; the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH climbed from 5,376 to 5,417 between April 9 and 10, reaching its highest level since September 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025.png" alt="Number of Addresses Holding Between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH." class="wp-image-686186" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025.png 3840w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Number of Addresses Holding Between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH.

<p>If Ethereum can maintain this renewed momentum, it may test key resistance levels at $1,749 and potentially rally further toward $1,954 and $2,104. However, macroeconomic uncertainty still looms. </p>



<p>A sentiment reversal could see <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum price</a> retesting the $1,412 support zone. If that level fails, a deeper decline toward $1,200—or even $1,000—is possible. </p>

<p>With the RWA narrative gaining traction, OM could see significant upside. Between April 6 and April 10, the number of OM whale addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens rose from 386 to 389, signaling quiet accumulation. </p>



<p>If OM breaks past the resistance levels at $6.51 and $6.85, it could climb above $7. However, if the momentum fades, a correction could push the token down to $6.11, with further downside risk toward $5.68.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-onyxcoin-xcn">Onyxcoin (XCN)</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/onyxcoin-buyers-pushes-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Onyxcoin (XCN) has surged</a> over 50% in the past 24 hours, breaking above the $0.02 mark as whale accumulation intensifies. </p>



<p>Between April 7 and April 10, the number of addresses holding between 1 million and 10 million XCN rose from 503 to 532, signaling renewed interest from large holders.</p>

<p>If this strong bullish momentum continues, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/onyxcoin-price-finds-whale-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCN could rally</a> toward resistance levels at $0.026, $0.033, and even $0.040. However, given the rapid price increase in a short timeframe, a correction may follow. </p>



<p>In that case, XCN could retest support at $0.020, with potential downside extending to $0.014 if selling pressure accelerates.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>FARTCOIN has been one of the standout performers in the meme coin space, with its price soaring nearly 250% over the last 30 days. After weeks of consistent gains, the token is now trading just below a key resistance level as technical indicators continue to support the bullish trend. </strong></p>



<p>Momentum remains strong, with on-chain metrics and chart patterns signaling that buyers are firmly in control. However, with such rapid gains, the risk of a sharp correction is also rising—making the coming days crucial for FARTCOIN’s next move.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-fartcoin-dmi-shows-buyers-are-in-full-control">FARTCOIN DMI Shows Buyers Are In Full Control</h2>



<p>FARTCOIN’s DMI chart shows a strong surge in trend strength, with the ADX rising from 22.3 to 39.93 over the past two days. </p>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-read-crypto-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Average Directional Index (ADX)</a> measures the strength of a trend, regardless of direction—readings above 25 signal a strong trend, while anything below 20 suggests a weak or nonexistent one.</p>



<p>FARTCOIN’s current ADX level indicates that a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-fartcoin-soars-two-month-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">powerful trend is now firmly in place</a>.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2658" height="678" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47.png" alt="FARTCOIN DMI." class="wp-image-686246" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47.png 2658w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47-360x92.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47-850x217.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47-768x196.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47-1536x392.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47-2048x522.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-12.29.47-150x38.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2658px) 100vw, 2658px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FARTCOIN DMI. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Looking at the directional indicators, the +DI climbed to 36.94 from 28.46 yesterday, recovering after a brief dip from 39.43 two days ago. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, the -DI has dropped further to 8.53 from 14.14, showing that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fartcoin-soars-uptrend-shows-signs-weakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bearish pressure continues to fade</a>. </p>



<p>This widening gap between +DI and -DI, combined with a rising ADX, signals strong bullish momentum, suggesting that FARTCOIN’s price could continue climbing if the current trend holds.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-fartcoin-ichimoku-cloud-shows-a-bullish-setup">FARTCOIN Ichimoku Cloud Shows A Bullish Setup</h2>



<p>FARTCOIN’s Ichimoku Cloud chart is currently showing a strong bullish setup. With its market cap close to $900 million, it is the biggest <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-pump-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin ever launched on PumpFun</a>. </p>



<p>The price action is well above both the Tenkan-sen (blue line) and Kijun-sen (red line), which are also trending upward—an indication of solid short-term momentum.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2710" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04.png" alt="FARTCOIN Ichimoku Cloud." class="wp-image-686244" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04-850x408.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04-768x368.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04-1536x737.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04-2048x982.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-30-04-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FARTCOIN Ichimoku Cloud. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>The cloud (Kumo) ahead is thick and green, with Leading Span A well above Leading Span B. This suggests strong support for the ongoing uptrend. </p>



<p>Additionally, the wide distance between the price and the cloud base reinforces the strength of the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fartcoin-rally-gains-while-market-falters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">current bullish momentum</a>. Unless a sharp reversal occurs, the trend remains clearly in favor of the bulls.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-will-fartcoin-break-above-1">Will FARTCOIN Break Above $1?</h2>



<p>FARTCOIN’s price chart currently displays a bullish EMA structure, with short-term moving averages positioned above long-term ones—indicating that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fartcoin-rally-continues-amid-meme-coin-frenzy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">momentum remains in favor of the bulls</a>. </p>



<p>The price is now approaching a critical resistance of around $0.90. If this level is successfully broken, the uptrend could accelerate further, with price targets at $1.29 and $1.99 coming into view.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2710" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15.png" alt="FARTCOIN Price Analysis." class="wp-image-686242" style="aspect-ratio:2.0910493827160495;width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15-850x408.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15-768x368.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15-1536x737.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15-2048x982.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/FARTCOINUSDT_2025-04-11_12-28-15-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">FARTCOIN Price Analysis.

<p>On the flip side, if the current momentum stalls and buyers lose control, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-solana-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin</a> may begin to retrace. The first support to watch lies at $0.639. </p>



<p>A drop below this level could trigger a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coins-weekly-fartcoin-popcat-brett/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deeper correction</a> toward $0.538 and $0.408. If that final support also fails and bearish pressure strengthens, the price could fall as low as $0.26—marking a full reversal of the recent rally.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Here are three meme coins to watch today: BYTE, FARTCOIN, and MUBARAK. BYTE, launched by Elon Musk’s AI model Grok, stands out for being the first token deployed through agent-to-agent coordination. </strong></p>



<p>FARTCOIN is riding a wave of momentum with a 105% surge in the past week, making it one of the top-performing meme coins in the market. Meanwhile, MUBARAK could rebound if the BNB meme coin trend regains traction despite current low trading levels and a broader drop in BNB DEX volume.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-byte-byte">Byte (BYTE)</h2>



<ul class="bic-gutenberg-list wp-list list-disc " class="wp-block-list">
<li><strong>Launch Date</strong> &#8211; March 2025</li>



<li><strong>Total Circulating Supply</strong> &#8211; 1 Billion BYTE</li>



<li><strong>Maximum Supply</strong> &#8211; 1 Billion BYTE</li>



<li><strong>Fully Diluted Valuation (FDV) </strong>&#8211; $125,000</li>
</ul>



<p>BYTE is the official dog-themed token launched by Grok, Elon Musk’s AI model, with the help of <a href="https://x.com/basedfk/status/1908729091433615663" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Cliza—an agentic token launchpad</a>.</p>



<p>The token was deployed directly through Cliza, making it what some in the crypto community call the first agent-to-agent memecoin launch. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1688" height="966" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-10.29.58.png" alt="BYTE Price Data." class="wp-image-686196" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-10.29.58.png 1688w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-10.29.58-360x206.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-10.29.58-850x486.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-10.29.58-768x440.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-10.29.58-1536x879.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-10.29.58-150x86.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1688px) 100vw, 1688px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BYTE Price Data.

<p>A new trend may be forming, with <a href="https://x.com/basedfk/status/1906842851742535764" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI agents beginning to independently create and deploy meme coins</a>. BYTE is at the center of this evolution. </p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Through multiple sessions it reiterated its intention to launch BYTE. If you go back to the launch post from Grok, it clearly shows that it had an understanding of the &#8216;hey cliza&#8217; command and even the rewards mechanism. This is a fascinating space to watch. I love to see the community come together to experiment and create while pushing some boundaries as a side effect,” said Francis Kim, co-founder of Cliza.ai.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Although BYTE is currently trading at all-time lows, if this <a href="https://beincrypto.com/defai-will-be-the-big-story-of-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-to-AI memecoin</a> trend accelerates, BYTE could be among the top beneficiaries—potentially climbing to test resistance levels at $0.00015, $0.00020, and even $0.00027.</p>



<p>BeInCrypto also asked Grok AI about its involvement with the meme coin and received an amusing response. </p>

<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-fartcoin-soars-two-month-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FARTCOIN has emerged</a> as one of the top-performing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/base-chain-meme-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coins</a> over the past week, with its price soaring over 105% in seven days and nearly 26% in the last 24 hours alone. </p>



<p>This explosive momentum has reignited interest in the token, pushing it back into the spotlight after months of strong corrections.</p>

<p>If the current uptrend holds, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/fartcoin-soars-uptrend-shows-signs-weakening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FARTCOIN could rally</a> further to test the $1 mark for the first time since January 31—a key psychological and technical resistance level. </p>



<p>However, if the rally loses steam, the token may retrace toward its immediate support at $0.639. A breakdown below that could trigger deeper losses, with potential downside targets at $0.538 and $0.408.</p>

<p>MUBARAK was one of the most talked-about <a href="https://beincrypto.com/binance-list-delist-bnb-chain-tokens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BNB meme coins</a> in recent weeks, capturing attention with its viral appeal. However, it&#8217;s currently trading near its lows. </p>



<p>Its popularity mirrored the broader hype across the BNB Chain meme coin space, which now appears to be fading.</p>

<p>Still, if BNB meme coins stage a recovery, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/mubarak-drops-despite-binance-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MUBARAK could benefit</a> from renewed interest and potentially climb to test resistance zones around $0.036 and $0.042</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>IP, PLUME, and GRASS are gaining steam after dominating Binance’s latest community poll—each poised for a major breakout if listed.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/altcoins-watch-binance-listing-in-april/">3 New Altcoins to Watch for Binance Listing in April</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>A potential Binance listing could be the next major catalyst for three rising altcoins: IP, PLUME, and GRASS. All three tokens recently appeared in Binance’s latest community listing poll. Each gained more votes than several projects that were ultimately listed. </strong></p>



<p>IP is riding a wave of momentum following a 200% surge, PLUME is gaining traction as real-world assets explode on-chain, and GRASS is drawing strong interest as the AI narrative regains strength. These predictions are based on community engagement and on-chain activity and should not be regarded as conclusive statements. </p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-story-ip">Story (IP)</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/ip-price-rises-but-weak-demand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Story Protocol</a> is a decentralized infrastructure designed to register, manage, and monetize intellectual property (IP) on-chain. It is gaining momentum as one of the hottest altcoins of the year, fueled by its strong ties to the booming artificial intelligence narrative through on-chain IP management and AI training data licensing. </p>



<p>Therefore, it aims to integrate creative works—such as stories, characters, and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ai-cryptocurrencies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artificial intelligence</a> training assets—into the blockchain.</p>



<p>All things considered, this makes it a top spot in Binance’s latest community poll. Its growing popularity and alignment with trending narratives make it a prime candidate for a Binance listing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2710" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09.png" alt="IP Price Analysis." class="wp-image-686267" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09-850x408.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09-768x368.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09-1536x737.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09-2048x982.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/IPUSDC_2025-04-11_13-05-09-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">IP Price Analysis. Source: <a href="https://tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Its native token, IP, surged over 200% between February 18 and March 25. </p>



<p>The token is now attempting to hold onto its $1 billion market cap. It was included in Binance’s latest listing poll, where it secured over 11% of the votes.</p>



<p>A Binance listing could give IP the exposure and liquidity needed to push its price above $5. Then, it has the potential to climb toward $5.43 and even break past $6, levels it briefly reached during its <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ip-bulls-drive-price-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous rally</a>.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-plume">PLUME</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/yzi-labs-invests-in-plume-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plume Network</a> is riding the real-world asset (RWA) wave, offering a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/layer-1-vs-layer-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Layer-1 blockchain</a> that brings tokenized assets on-chain—tapping into one of the fastest-growing narratives in crypto. </p>



<p>With ONDO, another RWA-focused coin, recently listed on Binance, Plume’s strong engagement among RWA coins and top placement in the exchange’s community poll make it a prime candidate to follow.</p>



<p>Additionally, with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/real-world-assets-rwa-altcoins-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">RWA value on-chain</a> recently surpassing $20 billion for the first time, the narrative around real-world assets is gaining fresh momentum.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2710" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39.png" alt="PLUME Price Analysis." class="wp-image-686272" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39-850x408.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39-768x368.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39-1536x737.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39-2048x982.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/PLUMEUSDT_2025-04-11_13-13-39-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">PLUME Price Analysis. Source: <a href="https://tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Plume positioned itself as a strong contender in this space by securing nearly 10% of the votes in Binance’s most recent listing poll. It surpassed tokens like ONDO and VIRTUAL that ultimately made the list.</p>



<p>Furthermore, if Plume secures a listing on Binance, the added exposure could fuel a sharp rally, potentially pushing PLUME above $0.20 and toward key targets at $0.247 and even above $0.30 for the first time ever.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-grass">GRASS</h2>



<p>GRASS stands out for its unique blend of the AI narrative and its position as a Solana-based altcoin. These are two of the most compelling themes in the current market.</p>



<p>As Solana network activity starts to pick up again and investor attention shifts back to its ecosystem, GRASS’s position in the AI ecosystem makes it a strong contender for a Binance listing.</p>



<p>In Binance’s most recent listing poll, GRASS outperformed several notable contenders. That includes ONDO, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/virtuals-protocol-surges-binance-listing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VIRTUAL</a>, and WAL—yet still awaits an official listing.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2710" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57.png" alt="GRASS Price Analysis." class="wp-image-686276" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57-850x408.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57-768x368.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57-1536x737.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57-2048x982.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GRASSUSDT_2025-04-11_13-25-57-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">GRASS Price Analysis. Source: <a href="https://tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Also, with AI-related tokens and Solana-based projects beginning to bounce back after a prolonged correction since late January, GRASS could be ready for a surge.</p>



<p>In conclusion, if Binance adds <a href="https://beincrypto.com/grass-surges-indicators-suggest-further-gains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GRASS to its listings</a>, the surge in exposure and trading volume could push the token above the $3 mark for the first time since January 6.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Altcoins Babylon (BABY), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and Wayfinder’s PROMPT are making waves despite a broader crypto market decline, with shifts in trading volume and sentiment shaping their price movements.</p>
<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/why-these-altcoins-trending-today/">Why These Altcoins Are Trending Today — April 11</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The broader crypto market has reversed Thursday&#8217;s gains, with activity plunging significantly over the past 24 hours. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization has dropped by over $100 billion in a single day as investors react to macroeconomic pressures and shifting sentiment. </strong></p>



<p>Despite the market-wide downturn, a handful of altcoins are generating notable interest. Some of them include Babylon (BABY), Fartcoin (FARTCOIN), and Wayfinder (PROMPT).&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-babylon-baby">Babylon (BABY)</h2>



<p>Today<strong>, </strong>BABY is a trending altcoin as Babylon, the Bitcoin staking protocol, officially <a href="https://beincrypto.com/babylon-baby-token-airdrop-launch-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launched</a> its layer-1 blockchain &#8220;Genesis.&#8221; This launch supports the expansion of Babylon’s staking protocol, which has already attracted over $4 billion in total value locked (TVL).</p>



<p>BABY is trading at $0.088 at press time, down 28% over the past 24 hours. Despite the sharp decline, the altcoin has seen a massive surge in trading volume, signaling heightened selling pressure among market participants. Trading volume has skyrocketed by over 8,000% in the past day, now sitting at $590 million.</p>



<p>When an asset&#8217;s price falls while trading volume rises, it indicates strong selling pressure as more participants are offloading the asset. If this continues, BABY could fall to $0.079.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35.png" alt="BABY Price Analysis." class="wp-image-686126" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BABYUSDT_2025-04-11_11-54-35-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BABY Price Analysis. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>However, if it sees a positive shift in market trends, BABY could reverse its current trend, break past the resistance at $0.089, and charge toward $0.097.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-fartcoin-fartcoin">Fartcoin (FARTCOIN)</h2>



<p>Solana-based <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/meme-coins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin</a> FARTCOIN is another altcoin trending today. It trades at a two-month high of $0.87, climbing 23% in the past day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Despite the severe market volatility witnessed this week, FARTCOIN has maintained its rally, rocketing over 80% in the past seven days.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the daily chart, the altcoin’s Chaikin Money Flow (CMF) rests above the center line and is in an uptrend. At press time, this momentum indicator, which measures how money flows into and out of an asset, is at 0.17.&nbsp;</p>



<p>A positive CMF reading like this means that buying pressure is dominant. It suggests that FARTCOIN traders are confident and that more money flows into the asset than out.</p>



<p>If this trend persists, FARTCOIN could <a href="https://beincrypto.com/meme-coin-fartcoin-soars-two-month-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continue its</a> rally toward $1.</p>

<p>Conversely, if traders resume profit-taking, it could trigger a price dip to $0.73.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-wayfinder-prompt">Wayfinder (PROMPT)</h2>



<p>Wayfinder’s newly launched PROMPT is a trending asset today. The altcoin launched on April 9 across major exchanges, including OKX, KuCoin, Bitget, Gate.io, Coinbase, and Binance Alpha.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, its debut was overshadowed by an <a href="https://x.com/tokentable/status/1910348352853770694" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MEV exploit,</a> wherein a bot named “Yoink” front-ran the airdrop to Kaito users, stealing 119 ETH.</p>



<p>This has triggered a post-launch decline in PROMPT’s value. It trades at $0.192, down 22% in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;If the selloffs continue, PROMPT could break below the $0.190 price range to trade at $0.187.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) surged 15% following Binance’s listing announcement, briefly reigniting bullish sentiment around the AI-linked token. However, the rally may be masking deeper concerns about the project’s fundamentals and long-term viability. </strong></p>



<p>On-chain data reveals weak user activity and declining protocol engagement, raising questions about whether the price move is sustainable. </p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-virtual-s-binance-fueled-rally-masks-weak-on-chain-fundamentals"><strong>VIRTUAL’s Binance-Fueled Rally Masks Weak On-Chain Fundamentals</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the recent price surge fueled by the announcement of a Binance listing, on-chain data suggests that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/virtual-price-drops-correction-deepens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Virtuals Protocol (VIRTUAL) is facing significant challenges</a> in terms of user adoption and protocol activity. </p>



<p>While market sentiment briefly turned bullish, the underlying metrics point to weakening fundamentals, casting doubt on the rally&#8217;s sustainability.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1876" height="924" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.49.56.png" alt="VIRTUAL Protocol and Agent Revenue (Daily)." class="wp-image-686155" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.49.56.png 1876w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.49.56-360x177.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.49.56-850x419.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.49.56-768x378.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.49.56-1536x757.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.49.56-150x74.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1876px) 100vw, 1876px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">VIRTUAL Protocol and Agent Revenue (Daily). Source: <a href="https://dune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dune</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Data from April 10 shows that daily revenue for VIRTUAL <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/crypto-ai-agents-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto AI agents</a> amounted to just $7,677, while the protocol itself generated only $137 on the same day—an underwhelming figure for a platform once valued at almost $5 billion in market cap. </p>



<p>This financial stagnation has not gone unnoticed; <a href="https://beincrypto.com/grayscale-assets-under-consideration-q2-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grayscale recently removed Virtuals Protocol from its Q2 2025 “Assets Under Consideration” list</a>, signaling a decline in institutional confidence.</p>



<p>Further on-chain analysis reveals a sharp drop in activity. Since March 16, the number of new tokens launched on the protocol has fallen dramatically to just 1 to 4 per day. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1888" height="1030" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.50.28.png" alt="VIRTUAL Tokens Launched." class="wp-image-686156" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.50.28.png 1888w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.50.28-360x196.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.50.28-850x464.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.50.28-768x419.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.50.28-1536x838.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.50.28-150x82.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1888px) 100vw, 1888px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">VIRTUAL Tokens Launched. Source: <a href="https://dune.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dune</a>.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This marks a steep decline from VIRTUAL’s all-time high of 1,350 agent launches in a single day on November 30, 2024. </p>



<p>The slowdown in token generation reflects waning interest from developers and users alike, despite the recent price-driven hype.</p>



<p>Altogether, these trends suggest that the current momentum around <a href="https://beincrypto.com/virtuals-protocol-targets-solana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VIRTUAL may be driven more by the Binance listing news than by any real resurgence in platform usage or innovation</a>. </p>



<p>Without meaningful improvements in on-chain engagement and protocol revenue, the surge risks being short-lived—potentially setting the stage for a correction once the listing excitement fades.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-momentum-builds-but-key-indicators-show-caution-for-virtual"><strong>Momentum Builds, But Key Indicators Show Caution for VIRTUAL</strong></h2>



<p>VIRTUAL’s RSI has jumped to 64.85 from 40.55 in just 24 hours, signaling a strong uptick in buying momentum after the Binance listing news.</p>



<p>The Relative Strength Index (RSI) is a momentum indicator ranging from 0 to 100. Readings above 70 suggest overbought conditions, while below 30 indicates oversold territory.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image aligncenter size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2640" height="676" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17.png" alt="VIRTUAL RSI." class="wp-image-686157" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17.png 2640w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17-360x92.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17-850x218.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17-768x197.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17-1536x393.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17-2048x524.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-11-at-08.53.17-150x38.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2640px) 100vw, 2640px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">VIRTUAL RSI.

<p>With VIRTUAL’s RSI nearing 70—but not crossing it—it shows growing strength, though it hasn’t reached overbought levels since March 24, hinting at limited follow-through behind the recent surge.</p>



<p>The Ichimoku Cloud for VIRTUAL shows a short-term breakout attempt, but <a href="https://beincrypto.com/virtual-indicators-show-uncertainty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underlying resistance remains strong</a>. </p>



<p>The price has just pierced into the red cloud, indicating an early test of a bearish zone that often acts as overhead resistance.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2710" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55.png" alt="VIRTUAL Ichimoku Cloud." class="wp-image-686158" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55-850x408.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55-768x368.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55-1536x737.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55-2048x982.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-53-55-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">VIRTUAL Ichimoku Cloud.

<p>The Leading Span A (green cloud boundary) is still below the Leading Span B (red boundary), confirming the cloud is bearish overall. </p>



<p>However, the upward move that pushed price into the cloud hints at potential trend reversal attempts if momentum continues.</p>



<p>The Tenkan-sen (blue line) has crossed above the Kijun-sen (red line), a short-term bullish signal. But with price still within the cloud and not clearly above it, confirmation of a full trend reversal is lacking. </p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-will-virtual-price-rally-continue">Will VIRTUAL Price Rally Continue?</h2>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/changpeng-zhao-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance founder CZ</a> recently stated that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/cz-ai-agents-token-need/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only 0.05% of AI agents truly need tokens</a>, a comment that casts doubt on the long-term utility of many AI-linked projects—including VIRTUAL. </p>



<p>Technically, VIRTUAL’s EMA lines still reflect bearish momentum, with short-term averages sitting below the longer-term ones. </p>



<p>If bullish sentiment holds, however, the token could test resistance at $0.619.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2710" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59.png" alt="VIRTUAL Price Analysis." class="wp-image-686159" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59.png 2710w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59-360x173.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59-850x408.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59-768x368.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59-1536x737.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59-2048x982.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/VIRTUALUSDT_2025-04-11_08-52-59-150x72.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2710px) 100vw, 2710px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">VIRTUAL Price Analysis.

<p>A breakout from that level may open the door for moves toward $0.747, and in the case of strong follow-through, even a rise to $0.84.</p>



<p>If the recent rally fades, VIRTUAL price risks falling to its immediate support near $0.516. </p>



<p>Losing that level could accelerate downside pressure, potentially dragging the price down to $0.411—a level that would signal a clear rejection of the current uptrend attempt.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Hedera’s HBAR has bucked the broader market dip to record a slight 1% rally over the past 24 hours. As of this writing, the altcoin trades at $0.17.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>This upward movement comes amidst signs of a resurgence in new demand for the altcoin, as highlighted by key technical indicators on the daily chart. </p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-hbar-bullish-trend-gains-strength">HBAR Bullish Trend Gains Strength</h2>



<p>Readings from HBAR’s Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) reveal that on April 9, the token’s&nbsp; MACD line (blue) climbed above its signal line (orange), forming a “golden cross.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/HBARUSDT_2025-04-11_10-45-55.png" alt="HBAR MACD.

Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>A golden cross occurs when the MACD line crosses above the signal line, signaling a potential bullish trend and increased <a href="https://beincrypto.com/hbar-futures-demand-for-longs-strengthens/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying pressure</a>. This confirms that HBAR’s upward momentum is gaining strength, especially as investors commonly view this pattern as a buy signal.</p>



<p>Moreover, as of this writing, HBAR’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) is poised to break above the 50-neutral line, highlighting the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/hedera-hbar-shows-bullish-indicators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spike in fresh</a> demand for the altcoin. It is currently at 49.17 and remains in an uptrend.</p>

<p>The RSI indicator measures an asset’s overbought and oversold market conditions. It ranges between 0 and 100. Values above 70 suggest that the asset is overbought and due for a price decline, while values under 30 indicate that the asset is oversold and may witness a rebound.</p>



<p>At 49.17 and climbing, HBAR’s RSI signals a gradual shift from bearish territory into a more neutral zone. If the altcoin’s RSI continues to rise above 50, it would signal increasing bullish sentiment, driving up <a href="https://beincrypto.com/hedera-hbar-rebounds-mixed-market-signals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HBAR’s value.&nbsp;</a></p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-hbar-eyes-0-19-amid-strong-buying-pressure">HBAR Eyes $0.19 Amid Strong Buying Pressure</h2>



<p>HBAR’s surge over the past day has pushed its price above the key resistance formed at $0.16, which has kept the token in a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/hbar-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downtrend since</a> March 30.</p>



<p>With growing buying pressure, the token could flip this zone into a support floor. If successful, it could propel HBAR’s price to $0.19.</p>

<p>However, if traders resume profit-taking, HBAR’s current rally would halt, and the token’s price could fall below $0.16 and decline toward $0.12.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>As leading coin Bitcoin weathers one of its most bearish weeks since the start of the year, on-chain data suggests that miners have contributed significantly to the growing sell-side pressure.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>On-chain data reveals that miners on the Bitcoin network have ramped up their coin-selling activity, a trend that could exacerbate the downward pressure on the coin’s price.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-bears-take-control-as-miner-reserve-dips">Bitcoin Bears Take Control as Miner Reserve Dips</h2>



<p>According to CryptoQuant’s data, the BTC miner reserve has steadily decreased this week. As of this writing, it stands at 1.80 million BTC, down 1% from the previous week.</p>



<p>The BTC’s miner reserve tracks the number of coins held in miners&#8217; wallets. It represents the coin reserves miners <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-rally-losing-steam-after-tariff-pause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have yet to sell.</a></p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="4000" height="2250" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners.png" alt="Bitcoin Miner Reserve" class="wp-image-686067" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners.png 4000w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners-360x203.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners-850x478.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners-768x432.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners-1536x864.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners-2048x1152.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Bitcoin-Miner-Reserve-All-Miners-150x84.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 4000px) 100vw, 4000px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Miner Reserve. Source: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoQuant</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>When the metric climbs, miners are holding onto more of their mined coins, often signaling confidence in future price increases. Conversely, when the reserve declines like this, miners are moving coins out of their wallets, usually to sell, confirming growing bearish sentiment against BTC.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The coin’s negative miner netflow further confirms this trend. As of April 10, this was -590.40.  BTC’s miner netflow tracks the difference between the amount of coins sent to exchanges versus what is withdrawn. </p>



<p>When its value is <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-long-term-holders-break-silence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">negative like</a> this, more coins are being moved from miner wallets to exchanges, typically a precursor to selling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With added downward pressure from this segment of BTC holders, the coin’s price could see deeper corrections in the short term if buying interest fails to counterbalance the ongoing liquidation.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-s-bearish-trend-could-see-price-fall-to-74-000">Bitcoin&#8217;s Bearish Trend Could See Price Fall to $74,000</h2>



<p>On the daily chart, BTC remains significantly below its Super Trend indicator, which forms dynamic resistance above its price at $90,911.</p>



<p>This indicator tracks the direction and strength of an asset&#8217;s price trend. It is displayed as a line on the price chart, changing color to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-losses-price-crashes-below-80000/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">signify the trend</a>: green for an uptrend and red for a downtrend.</p>



<p>When an asset’s price trades below its Super Trend indicator, selling pressure dominates the market.&nbsp;This bearish trend could further prompt BTC holders to sell, worsening its price dip. If this happens, the coin’s price could fall below the key support at $80,776 to trade at $74,389.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, if market sentiment improves and coin holders reduce their selling activity, BTC could reverse its downtrend and rally <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/how-to-buy-and-store-the-different-types-of-tether" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to $86,172.</a></p>
