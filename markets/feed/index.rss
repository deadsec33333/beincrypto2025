										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Solana plunged to a 12-month low of $95.23 on April 7, marking a sharp decline amid broader market turbulence.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>However, as the market embarked on a recovery this week, SOL has witnessed a rebound, with its price climbing as demand surges.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-sol-rebounds-17-eyes-further-gains">SOL Rebounds 17%, Eyes Further Gains</h2>



<p>Since SOL began its current rally, its value has soared by 17%. At press time, the altcoin trades at $124.58, resting atop an ascending trend line.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img fetchpriority="high" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-26-02.png" alt="

<p>This pattern emerges when the price of an asset consistently makes higher lows over a period of time. It represents an <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-rebounds-but-selling-pressure-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uptrend</a>, indicating that SOL demand is gradually increasing, driving its prices higher. It suggests that the coin buyers are willing to pay more, and it serves as a support level during price corrections.</p>



<p>SOL’s recovery is further supported by its rising Relative Strength Index (RSI), indicating increasing buying interest. This momentum indicator is at 49.58 at press time, poised to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-sol-price-crashes-below-key-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break above</a> the 50-neutral line.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27.png" alt="SOL RSI" class="wp-image-686432" style="width:998px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_09-49-27-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SOL RSI. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The RSI indicator measures an asset’s overbought and oversold market conditions. It ranges between 0 and 100. Values above 70 suggest that the asset is overbought and due for a price decline, while values under 30 indicate that the asset is oversold and may witness a rebound.</p>



<p>At 49.50 and climbing, SOL’s RSI signals a steady shift in momentum from bearish to bullish. A rise above 50 would confirm increasing <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/what-is-solana" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buying pressure</a> and a potential for a sustained upward price movement.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-solana-bulls-eye-138">Solana Bulls Eye $138</h2>



<p>SOL’s ascending trend line forms a solid support floor below its price at $120.74. If demand soars and the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/solana-price-rises-supply-distribution-hits-monthly-high/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bullish presence</a> with the SOL spot markets strengthens, the coin could continue its rally and climb to $138.41.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23.png" alt="SOL Price Analysis" class="wp-image-686434" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/SOLUSDT_2025-04-12_10-30-23-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">SOL Price Analysis.

<p>However, if profit-taking commences, the support at $120.74 would be breached, and the SOL’s price could revisit $95.23.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Ripple’s long-running legal clash with the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) appears to be nearing its final chapter. </strong></p>



<p>However, a surprising detail has emerged from the ongoing settlement talks, which could see Ripple pay its reduced $50 million penalty using its native token, XRP.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ripple-could-use-xrp-token-to-pay-sec-fine">Ripple Could Use XRP Token to Pay SEC Fine</h2>



<p>On April 11, Ripple CEO Brad Garlinghouse appeared on FOX Business. At the interview, he revealed that the idea of paying the penalty in XRP was floated during settlement discussions.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;The SEC is going to end up with $50 million and the US government gets $50 million and we talked about making that available in XRP,&#8221; Garlinghouse <a href="https://www.foxbusiness.com/video/6371372424112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The ongoing negotiations follow Ripple&#8217;s and the SEC&#8217;s decision to drop their appeals, bringing the multi-year legal battle closer to closure. </p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We’re moving past the SEC’s war on crypto and entering the next phase of the market &#8211; true institutional flows integrating with decentralized finance,&#8221; Garlinghouse<a href="https://x.com/bgarlinghouse/status/1910825033334940071" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> added</a> in a post on X.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Judge Analisa Torres originally set the fine at $125 million in 2024, linking it to Ripple’s unregistered XRP sales to institutional investors. Ripple complied by placing the funds in an interest-bearing account, but the appeals process delayed any further action.</p>



<p>With those <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-drops-xrp-lawsuit-against-ripple/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeals now abandoned, </a>Ripple is expected to pay a reduced fine of $50 million. </p>



<p>A recent joint court filing confirms that both sides have reached a preliminary agreement. They are now seeking <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-sec-file-joint-motion-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final approval from the SEC’s commissioners</a>. </p>



<p>Once internal reviews are complete, the parties plan to request a formal ruling from the district court.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;There is good cause for the parties’ joint request that this Court put these appeals in abeyance. The parties have reached an agreement-in-principle, subject to Commission approval, to resolve the underlying case, the Commission’s appeal, and Ripple’s cross-appeal. The parties require additional time to obtain Commission approval for this agreement-in-principle, and if approved by the Commission, to seek an indicative ruling from the district court,&#8221; the filing stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If the commission votes in favor, this case could conclude one of the most closely watched regulatory battles in crypto history. More importantly, the use of XRP for the settlement could mark a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-to-rethink-crypto-trading-oversight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">significant shift in the SEC’s approach to digital assets</a>.</p>



<p>This turnaround would represent a major regulatory shift and could trigger further bullish momentum for the token. </p>



<p>Since <a href="https://beincrypto.com/donald-trump-wins-over-harris/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Donald Trump&#8217;s election victory in November 2024,</a> investor <a href="https://beincrypto.com/xrp-price-rise-will-be-driven-by-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confidence in XRP has grown sharply,</a> pushing the token&#8217;s value up by more than 300%. </p>



<p>At the same time, institutional interest continues to rise, as seen in the wave of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-xrp-etf-deadline-begins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spot exchange-traded fund applications tied to the token</a></p>



<p>Market analysts have linked this performance to the friendlier political climate. They also point to the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-ripple-xrp-commodity-rumors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential reclassification of XRP as a commodity</a> as a key factor driving the asset’s rise.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p> Ethereum ETFs recorded consistent outflows, with institutional investors retreating and lowering ETH’s price. Technical indicators suggest further declines may push ETH below $1,500.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Ethereum ETFs have closed yet another week in the red, recording net outflows amid continued investor hesitation.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Notably, there has been no single week of net inflows since the end of February, highlighting waning institutional interest in ETH-related products.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-etfs-face-steady-outflows">Ethereum ETFs Face Steady Outflows</h2>



<p>Ethereum-backed ETFs have recorded their seventh consecutive week of net outflows, highlighting <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-marks-yearly-low/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sustained institutional</a> hesitance toward the asset.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This week alone, net outflows from spot ETH ETFs totaled $82.47 million, marking a 39% surge from the $49 million recorded in outflows the previous week.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2688" height="868" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04.png" alt="Total Ethereum Spot ETF Net Inflow" class="wp-image-686420" style="width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04.png 2688w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-360x116.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-850x274.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-768x248.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-1536x496.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-2048x661.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-09.34.04-150x48.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2688px) 100vw, 2688px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Total Ethereum Spot ETF Net Inflow. Source: <a href="https://sosovalue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SosoValue</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>With the steady decline in institutional presence in the ETH market, the selling pressure on the coin has soared.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over the past week, ETH’s price has declined by 11%. The steady outflows from the funds backed by the coin suggest that the downward momentum may persist, increasing the likelihood of a price drop below the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-solana-nokia-irrelevance-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$1,500 mark.</a></p>



<p>On the price chart, technical indicators remain bearish, confirming the mounting pressure from the selling side of the market. For example, at press time, readings from ETH’s Directional Movement Index (DMI) show its positive directional index (+DI) resting below the negative directional index (-DI).&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23.png" alt="" class="wp-image-686421" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/ETHUSD_2025-04-12_09-37-23-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ETH DMI. Source: <a href="https://www.tradingview.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TradingView</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The DMI indicator measures the strength of an asset’s price trend. It consists of two lines: the +DI, which represents upward <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price movement</a>, and the -DI, which represents downward price movement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As with ETH, when the +DI rests below the -DI, the market is in a bearish trend, with downward price movement dominating the market sentiment.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-s-price-could-drop-below-1-500">Ethereum’s Price Could Drop Below $1,500</h2>



<p>The lack of institutional capital could delay any significant rebound in ETH price, further dampening short-term prospects for recovery. If demand leans further, ETH could break out of its narrow range and follow a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-eth-rallies-key-indicators-bearish/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">downward trend</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The altcoin could fall below $1,500 in this scenario to reach $1,395.</p>

<p>However, if ETH witnesses a positive shift in sentiment and demand spikes, its price could climb to $2,114.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-to-rethink-crypto-trading-oversight/">SEC Rethinks Crypto Rules—Uyeda Advocates for Federal Oversight and Industry Input</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Mark Uyeda, Acting Chair of the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), has encouraged crypto industry participants to offer input on a proposed framework. The initiative is designed to ease regulatory pressure on digital asset trading.</strong></p>



<p>Speaking at the SEC’s April 11 Crypto Task Force roundtable, Uyeda highlighted the growing disconnect between current regulations and the realities of blockchain innovation.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-sec-considers-federal-licensing-model-to-streamline-crypto-compliance">SEC Considers Federal Licensing Model to Streamline Crypto Compliance</h2>



<p>Uyeda likened the evolution of crypto markets to the early days of US securities trading, which began under a buttonwood tree in New York City.</p>



<p>He argued that early brokers created rules that suited the needs of their time. In the same way, modern regulators must now consider frameworks that align with the distinct structure of crypto platforms.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional exchanges, crypto trading systems often combine custody, execution, and clearing into one platform. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sonic-blockchain-tvl-capital-flows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blockchain technology</a> makes this integration possible.</p>



<p>Uyeda pointed out that this setup can improve transparency, efficiency, and trading speed. He also highlighted benefits like 24/7 trading through smart contracts and streamlined collateral management via tokenization.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Blockchain technology offers the potential to execute and clear securities transactions in ways that may be more efficient and reliable than current processes,&#8221; Uyeda <a href="https://www.sec.gov/newsroom/speeches-statements/uyeda-remarks-ctf-roundtable-crypto-trading-041125" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Still, Uyeda acknowledged that the architects of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/coinbase-sec-legal-battle-court-win/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">US securities laws</a> never anticipated <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/blockchain-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blockchain technology</a> or decentralized systems. As a result, compliance challenges have emerged as many tokenized securities remain unregistered and ineligible for national exchanges.</p>



<p>Besides that, existing rules, such as the order protection rule, are also difficult to apply in hybrid <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-crypto-trading-platforms-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trading environments</a> where assets move between on-chain and off-chain systems.</p>



<p>Uyeda also criticized the current patchwork of state-by-state licensing requirements, which create <a href="https://beincrypto.com/immutable-gets-sec-wells-notice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">barriers for crypto firms</a> aiming to operate nationwide.</p>



<p>To address these gaps, Uyeda proposed a conditional relief framework that could support experimentation while maintaining investor protections. He also suggested that a unified federal licensing model <a href="https://beincrypto.com/how-paul-atkins-will-reset-us-crypto-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">under the SEC</a> could simplify <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-crypto-policy-overhaul-trump-inauguration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compliance and enhance market consistency.</a></p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Under an accommodating federal regulatory framework, some market participants would likely prefer to offer trading in both tokenized securities and non-security crypto assets under a single SEC license rather than offer trading solely in non-security crypto assets under fifty different state licenses,&#8221; Uyeda said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nonetheless, he invited industry experts to recommend specific areas where such relief would unlock practical use cases without undermining market integrity.</p>



<p>Uyeda’s remarks signal the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-reconsiders-howey-test-crypto-oversight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SEC’s growing awareness</a> that digital asset regulation must evolve. While long-term reform may take time, the proposed relief framework could create room for innovation without compromising market safeguards</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Despite lingering market uncertainty fueled by Donald Trump’s escalating trade war, the cryptocurrency market showed signs of recovery this week.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>On-chain data reveals that crypto whales took advantage of the volatility to accumulate select altcoins, signaling growing confidence in specific digital assets.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-dogecoin-doge">Dogecoin (DOGE)</h2>



<p>Leading <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/meme-coins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">meme coin</a> Dogecoin (DOGE) has received significant attention from crypto whales this week. This is reflected by the spike in the number of coins purchased over the past seven days by DOGE whale addresses that hold between 100 million and 1 billion coins. </p>



<p>According to data from Santiment, these DOGE holders have accumulated 1.41 billion coins worth over $220 million during the review period. As of press time, their total holdings have surged to 25.68 billion DOGE, marking the highest level since December last year.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025.png" alt="DOGE Supply Distribution" class="wp-image-686413" style="width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025.png 3840w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Dogecoin-DOGE-08.47.38-12-Apr-2025-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">DOGE Supply Distribution. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>When an asset’s large holders increase their accumulation like this, it suggests increased confidence or anticipation of future price gains. If this continues, DOGE could break above the resistance at $0.17 in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-price-long-liquidations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the near term</a> and climb toward $0.23.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-worldcoin-wld">Worldcoin (WLD)</h2>



<p>WLD is another altcoin that has caught whales’ attention this week. The Sam Altman-linked token currently trades at&nbsp; $0.74, shedding 1% of its value over the past week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During that period, whales holding between 100,000 and 1,000,000 WLD have accumulated 2.63 million tokens valued above $1.94 million.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025.png" alt="WLD Supply Distribution" class="wp-image-686390" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025.png 3840w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Worldcoin-on-Ethereum-WLD-07.10.14-12-Apr-2025-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">WLD Supply Distribution. Source: <a href="https://app.santiment.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Santiment</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>If whale accumulation persists, it could make WLD buck the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/wld-price-rises-smart-money/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broader market</a> downtrend to record gains.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ondo-ondo">Ondo (ONDO)</h2>



<p>The<strong> </strong><a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/real-world-asset-tokens" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">real-world asset-based</a> (RWA) token ONDO is also on this week’s crypto whales’ list. According to Santiment, in the past seven days, whales holding between 1 million and 10 million ONDO have purchased 19.41 million, valued at approximately $17 million.</p>



<p>This cohort of ONDO investors currently holds 702.37 million coins.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025.png" alt="ONDO Supply Distribution" class="wp-image-686391" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025.png 3840w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ondo-ONDO-07.11.18-12-Apr-2025-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">ONDO Supply Distribution.

<p>Should this prompt a market-wide ONDO accumulation phase, it could signal the resurgence of interest in RWA-based assets and drive further price momentum in the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ondo-whales-pull-back-price-at-risk/">coming weeks.&nbsp;</a></p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Binance has drawn renewed attention after reports emerged that its executives met privately with officials from the US Treasury in March. </strong></p>



<p>The meetings, first reported by The Wall Street Journal, allegedly focused on easing regulatory pressure as the exchange seeks a fresh path into the American market.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-zhao-denies-report-linking-him-to-investigation-into-justin-sun">Zhao Denies Report Linking Him to Investigation Into Justin Sun</h2>



<p>This development follows <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-justice-department-binance-settle-case-bnb/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Binance’s $4.3 billion settlement with the US Department of Justice</a> in 2023, which centered on past violations of anti-money laundering laws. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, speculation is mounting that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/pay-to-reach-changpeng-zhao-binance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao</a> may be cooperating with US authorities—potentially in investigations related to TRON founder Justin Sun.</p>



<p>While no official confirmation has surfaced, the idea of Zhao assisting in a case against Sun has raised eyebrows. Sun has previously faced <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-justin-sun-settlement-civil-fraud-case/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">scrutiny over alleged securities violations</a> and financial misconduct. </p>



<p>Zhao, however, has dismissed the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/finance/regulation/binance-world-liberty-financial-crypto-deals-70c817c3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WSJ article</a> as sensationalist, suggesting it was crafted to generate clicks. He also hinted at fresh lobbying efforts against Binance but did not elaborate.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Multiple people have told me again WSJ is writing another baseless hit piece about me,&#8221; Zhao <a href="https://x.com/cz_binance/status/1910588384168255829?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In response, Justin Sun released a statement denying any wrongdoing. He emphasized that his communications with US authorities have remained open and cooperative. </p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;The US Department of Justice has been one of T3FCU’s closest and most trusted partners. Together, we’ve collaborated on numerous cases aimed at protecting users around the world. Whether it’s CZ or our partners at the DOJ, we maintain direct, honest communication at all times. I have full trust in each and every one of them,&#8221; Sun <a href="https://x.com/justinsuntron/status/1910876115612406267?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stressed</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Sun also underscored his confidence in Zhao&#8217;s leadership and the potential for US crypto policy to evolve under a more supportive regulatory environment.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;CZ is both my mentor and a close friend—he has played a crucial role in supporting me during my entrepreneurial journey. To this day, his conduct and principles remain the highest standard I strive to follow as a founder,&#8221; Sun stated.</p>
</blockquote>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-eyes-stablecoin-partnership-with-wlfi">Binance Eyes Stablecoin Partnership With WLFI</h2>



<p>In a separate but equally notable move, Binance is reportedly exploring a partnership with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/wlfi-cryptocurrency-investment-mantle-network/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World Liberty Financial (WLFI),</a> a decentralized finance project said to have ties to President Donald Trump’s family. </p>



<p>At the center of the talks is the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/world-liberty-financial-launches-usd1-stablecoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DeFi venture&#8217;s recently released stablecoin called USD1</a>, which WLFI aims to list on Binance. </p>



<p>If the deal goes through, it could mark a significant strategic gain for both parties. WLFI would secure a global platform for USD1, while Binance could regain political goodwill as it eyes reentry into the US market.</p>



<p>Market analysts say Binance’s infrastructure could fast-track USD1’s adoption, particularly as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/asia-stablecoin-growth-financial-adoption/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stablecoin demand grows </a>amid shifting US regulations.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Originally launched as a parody of crypto speculation, Dogecoin has since become the kind of speculative asset it was meant to mock — largely due to Elon Musk’s influence. His social media activity and public endorsements have played a central and ongoing role in shaping DOGE&#8217;s trajectory.</strong></p>



<p>BeInCrypto spoke with Erwin Voloder, Head of Policy of the European Blockchain Association, to discuss how Musk blurred the lines between parody and promotion, leading people to assign real-world value to a meme and generating ethical concerns along the way.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-the-genesis-of-dogecoin"><strong>The Genesis of Dogecoin</strong></h2>



<p>Toward the end of 2013, software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer joined forces to create <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/buy-dogecoin/">Dogecoin</a>, the first meme coin in crypto history. Its primary purpose was to serve as a lighthearted parody of the chaotic crypto hype. </p>



<p>Born from the &#8220;Doge&#8221; internet meme, which <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/dogecoin-vs-shiba-inu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prominently featured a Shiba Inu</a>, the meme coin was intended as a humorous jab at the often illogical nature of crypto speculation.</p>



<p>Despite its satirical origins, Dogecoin quickly gained a dedicated online following—so much so that even Tesla CEO Elon Musk became drawn to it. </p>



<p>Today, he’s considered a key figure in the community, and Dogecoin, contrary to its initial philosophy, has become a speculative asset.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Musk’s involvement transformed Dogecoin from a satirical internet token into a speculative asset class by bestowing it with perceived legitimacy and entertainment value. His tweets and appearances turned Dogecoin into a cultural product rather than a financial one—a kind of performance art with real economic consequences. The irony is that a coin created to mock irrational investing became the poster child of irrational investing,” Voloder told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In addition to symbolic endorsements, Musk has exerted concrete influence. A prime example is Tesla&#8217;s early 2022 <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-reserve-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decision to accept Dogecoin</a> for select merchandise, significantly strengthening its position and indicating its practical potential.</p>



<p>Musk also didn’t hesitate to use social media to convey his love for Dogecoin.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-how-did-musk-s-tweets-impact-dogecoin-s-market"><strong>How Did Musk&#8217;s Tweets Impact Dogecoin&#8217;s Market?</strong></h2>



<p><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Throughout the years, Elon Musk, a prolific Twitter user even before he bought the platform</span>, has shared numerous posts referencing Dogecoin. Each of these tweets has substantially impacted the meme coin’s visibility and price performance. </p>



<p>When <a href="https://beincrypto.com/doge-dogecoin-price-analysis-04-04-2019/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Musk referred to Dogecoin in an April 2019 tweet</a> as his favorite cryptocurrency, the market went berserk. In two days, the coin&#8217;s price went from $0.002 on April 1 to as high as $0.004.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Dogecoin might be my fav cryptocurrency. It’s pretty cool.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href="https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1113009339743100929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 2, 2019</a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
</div></figure>



<p>Two years later, Musk&#8217;s X posts declaring &#8220;Dogecoin is the people&#8217;s crypto&#8221; triggered an overnight trading volume surge of over 50%.</p>



<p>Soon enough, retail investors started to follow Musk’s endorsements mindlessly. But it wasn’t all butterflies and roses. Musks’s unpredictable pronouncements also came with extreme volatility.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Musk blurred the line between parody and promotion, which led people to assign real-world value to a meme. Without him, it may have remained a niche internet joke but with him, it became a symbol of speculative absurdity,” Voloder said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Musk called Dogecoin ‘a hustle’ on Saturday Night Live in May 2021, the coin lost more than a third of its price in a few hours.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Dogecoin has no clear roadmap, no underlying yield or utility, and limited development activity, meaning its valuation is especially sentiment-driven. In such an environment, a single individual’s actions can drive or destroy market perception, particularly when that individual is one of the world&#8217;s most followed and wealthiest people,” he added.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Then, in January 2025, President Trump appointed Musk as the head of a newly created agency tasked with cutting federal spending. </p>



<p>Musk called it the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/elon-musk-doge-to-investigate-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Department of Government Efficiency, or D.O.G.E. for short</a>. The name was intentional, and the internet broke accordingly. </p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-d-o-g-e-and-the-price-plunge-what-s-the-correlation"><strong>D.O.G.E. and the Price Plunge: What&#8217;s the Correlation?</strong></h2>



<p>President Trump launched the D.O.G.E. department by executive order on his first day on the job. After D.O.G.E. launched its official government website, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/elon-musk-triggers-dogefather-token-rally/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dogecoin’s price surged</a> by 13% in 15 minutes, breaking its previous short-term downtrend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yet, since the official establishment of the Department of Government Efficiency, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-price-tumbles-after-musk-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOGE&#8217;s price has been freefalling</a>. While valued at $0.36 on January 20, its price has since fallen to $0.15 today.</p>

<p>Findings from a recent Finbold <a href="https://finbold.com/over-40-of-dogecoin-millionaires-wiped-out-since-elon-musk-began-d-o-g-e/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a> have also revealed that Musk might now be having the opposite effect on Dogecoin’s value and sentiment.</p>



<p>According to the data, the number of Dogecoin millionaire addresses has plunged by over 41% between January 21 and March 31. In just over two months, the cryptocurrency has decreased by 964 addresses.</p>



<p>Notably, the report indicated a massive proportional decline in the number of the wealthiest Dogecoin addresses. The count of addresses holding $1 million to $9.99 million decreased by 40.21% in Q1 2025. </p>



<p>Even more significantly, the number of addresses holding over $10 million plummeted by 47%, from 400 to 212.</p>



<p>In short, Dogecoin whales are dumping the token. </p>

<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Musk’s influence remains a key variable in Dogecoin’s valuation, and the timing of the drop in high-value addresses closely aligns with his D.O.G.E. announcement, suggesting a correlation. However, attributing the entire reversal to Musk overlooks broader macro factors like rising interest rates, tighter crypto regulation, and waning retail enthusiasm post-2021,” Voloder explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the difficulty of assessing the precise impact of Elon Musk&#8217;s D.O.G.E. leadership on Dogecoin&#8217;s performance, his significant influence on the cryptocurrency has become evident.</p>



<p>The ethical considerations accompanying Musk’s influence have also become difficult to ignore.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-the-ethical-concerns-of-a-billionaire-s-influence"><strong>The Ethical Concerns of a Billionaire&#8217;s Influence</strong></h2>



<p>According to Voloder, the Dogecoin case illustrates the perils of parasocial investing, a behavior in which people mistakenly assign credibility to famous personalities based on their celebrity status or charisma.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It further shows the damaging effects of uncritical reliance on endorsements, potentially leading to substantial financial losses for retail investors.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://beincrypto.com/democrats-ethics-probe-trump-crypto/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ethics of a billionaire influencing a volatile market</a> like cryptocurrency also present significant complexities.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“On one hand, Musk has the right to express personal views and participate in public discourse, including around assets like Dogecoin. On the other, his outsized influence means that his commentary can trigger real financial harm or euphoria in retail investors who often lack access to sophisticated risk models. Ethically, when you wield that kind of influence, there’s a strong argument for assuming a higher standard of responsibility—especially in a market with minimal guardrails,” Voloder told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Given the unregulated nature of the cryptocurrency industry, it’s currently challenging to pinpoint the degree to which Musk&#8217;s actions can be held responsible.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-does-musk-s-influence-constitute-market-manipulation"><strong>Does Musk&#8217;s Influence Constitute Market Manipulation?</strong></h2>



<p>Although presented as personal opinions, Musk&#8217;s tweets demonstrably affect Dogecoin&#8217;s price, creating a legal gray area regarding potential market manipulation under US securities and commodities laws.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Under SEC rules, market manipulation involves intentional conduct designed to deceive or defraud investors by controlling or artificially affecting market prices. While Dogecoin is not officially deemed a security, and thus outside the SEC&#8217;s traditional remit, the CFTC could still scrutinize it under its anti-manipulation powers for commodities,” Voloder explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Dogecoin case isn’t the first time a high-profile figure has influenced markets in ways that were manipulative, though not explicitly illegal. </p>



<p>Voloder highlighted two instances at different points in the 20th century: when prominent banker JP Morgan steered markets during the panic of 1907 and investor George Soros broke the Bank of England in 1992. </p>



<p>Though their maneuvers were technically legal, they managed to sway market outcomes. However, this was the 20th century, and their impact was proportionally much smaller.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The difference today is that social media provides instantaneous reach to millions of investors, amplifying the potential impact. So even if Musk’s tweets are framed as personal musings, their predictable effect on price can be seen as a form of market signaling—intentional or not,” Voloder told BeInCrypto.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In fact, the SEC and legal experts are already debating Elon Musk&#8217;s potential influence on Dogecoin&#8217;s financial market activities.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-a-258-billion-lawsuit"><strong>A $258 Billion Lawsuit</strong></h2>



<p>Elon Musk currently faces a $258 billion class action lawsuit for running a Dogecoin pyramid scheme.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The lawsuit, filed in June 2022, claims that Musk intentionally promoted Dogecoin through his tweets, public appearances, and media interactions, creating hype and driving up demand.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to the plaintiffs, this artificial inflation of Dogecoin&#8217;s price allowed Musk and his companies to profit while leaving other investors with substantial losses when the price inevitably declined.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Due to the SEC&#8217;s unclear legal classification of cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin, Voloder anticipates a difficult path for these claims in court. Nevertheless, the lawsuit indicates increased attention to market manipulation by influential figures.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Still, the lawsuit signals increased legal pressure to define where promotional enthusiasm ends and financial misconduct begins. If regulators or courts decide Musk knowingly manipulated the market or misled investors, he could face civil penalties or be forced into settlements. The SEC’s earlier scrutiny of Musk’s Tesla tweets, resulting in a consent decree, shows that regulators are willing to act when market-moving speech crosses certain lines,” Voloder explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Musk&#8217;s influence on Dogecoin continues unabated, and the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/dogecoin-stability-tested-long-term-holders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-term effects on the Dogecoin community</a> remain a subject of debate.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-will-dogecoin-s-community-resilience-endure"><strong>Will Dogecoin&#8217;s Community Resilience Endure?</strong></h2>



<p>The rapid 40% decrease in Dogecoin whale addresses within two months has raised questions about the meme coin&#8217;s future strength and resilience.</p>



<p>However, DOGE&#8217;s fundamental strength still remains intact – it&#8217;s community. </p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“While the initial hype has faded, Dogecoin still retains a loyal base of enthusiasts, many of whom appreciate its meme-driven culture, low transaction fees, and iconic branding. But the big speculative crowd that initially drove its [all-time high] has largely left the field in absence of sustained bullish narratives or meaningful tech upgrades,” Voloder concluded.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the future, traders will be watching to see if Dogecoin&#8217;s &#8216;cult following&#8217; eventually dwindles or if a strong community will sustain the &#8216;OG meme coin&#8217;.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-bitcoin-surge-fed-liquidity/">Arthur Hayes: ‘Buy Everything’ as Bitcoin Enters ‘UP ONLY’ Mode Amid Fed Liquidity Signals</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX, has urged market participants to &#8220;buy everything&#8221; following recent signals from the US Federal Reserve.</strong></p>



<p>In an April 11 post on X, Hayes suggested that investors consider broad exposure to the crypto markets as central banks show signs of stepping in to stabilize the system.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-hayes-sees-market-stress-as-cue-to-buy-bitcoin">Hayes Sees Market Stress as Cue to Buy Bitcoin</h2>



<p>Hayes previously pointed to rising bond yields, particularly the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-10-year-treasury-yield-bitcoin-appeal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10-year US Treasury rate</a> climbing above 4.5%, as a potential trigger for government intervention. </p>



<p>He argued that such pressure could force the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/stealth-quantitative-easing-fed-markets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fed to inject fresh liquidity</a>, creating <a href="https://beincrypto.com/arthur-hayes-tariff-war-bitcoin/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorable conditions for risk assets—especially Bitcoin</a>. According to <a href="https://x.com/CryptoHayes/status/1910756361409094057" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hayes</a>, this scenario could lead to a prolonged upward move in crypto and broader markets.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;We will be getting more policy response this weekend if this keeps up. We are about to enter UP ONLY mode for BTC,&#8221; Hayes <a href="https://x.com/CryptoHayes/status/1910707923824894114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">stated</a>.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Fed’s stance appears to support this view. Susan Collins, President of the Boston Federal Reserve, recently told the <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/0273371d-b90c-43e4-845a-e51982dd4fdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> that while the markets are still functioning properly, the Fed stands ready to act if liquidity becomes strained.</p>



<p>Collins emphasized that the central bank has tools in place to ensure market stability if disruptions emerge. However, She stressed that the rate cuts are not the Fed’s first line of defense as other tools are available to stabilize financial markets when needed.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;The core interest rate tool we use for monetary policy is, certainly not the only tool in the toolkit and probably not the best way to address challenges of liquidity or market functioning<em>,</em>&#8221; she said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>These developments come at a time when the global economy is already under stress. <a href="https://beincrypto.com/crypto-assets-tariff-volatility-inflation-fears/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">President Donald Trump’s new wave of tariffs</a> has added fresh uncertainty to financial markets.</p>



<p>Though the administration paused its new tariff schedule for 90 days, it sharply increased duties on Chinese goods to 145%. China has since responded with its own tariff hikes, lifting <a href="https://beincrypto.com/china-raises-us-tariffs-crypto-steady/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rates on American imports from 84% to as much as 125%</a>.</p>



<p>These tit-for-tat measures have raised fears of an inflation spike in the US, along with possible job losses and weaker economic growth. Wall Street has already experienced a significant selloff, and US Treasury markets are showing signs of strain.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, despite the short-term suspension of new trade penalties, underlying tensions remain high. For Hayes, however, the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/us-raise-debt-ceiling-will-crypto-benefit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">combination of macro stress</a> and central bank intervention presents a clear signal: this may be the moment to accumulate assets before the tide turns.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Leading coin Bitcoin has had a turbulent past few weeks, with its price troubles prompting many short-term investors—often referred to as &#8220;paper hands&#8221;—to exit the market.&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>However, amidst the price volatility, the coin’s long-term holders (LTHs) remain resolute and show no signs of backing down as they attempt to push BTC back above $85,000. How soon can they realize this?</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-bitcoin-long-term-holders-shift-from-selling-to-stacking">Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Shift From Selling to Stacking</h2>



<p>In a recent <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/insights/quicktake/67f982c6b71f0960817db375-Are-Long-Term-Holders-Switching-from-Distribution-to-Accumulation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report</a>, CryptoQuant analyst Burak Kesmeci assessed BTC’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change (30d sum) and found that <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-price-fails-to-secure-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since April 6</a>, the metric has turned positive, showing clear upward momentum. As a result, Kesmeci wrote, BTC has risen by approximately 12%. </p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full is-resized"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="1238" height="832" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59.png" alt="Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Change" class="wp-image-686400" style="width:1024px;height:auto" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59.png 1238w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-360x242.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-850x571.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-768x516.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.26.59-150x101.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 1238px) 100vw, 1238px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Bitcoin Long-Term Holder Net Position Change. Source: <a href="https://cryptoquant.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CryptoQuant</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>BTC’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change tracks the buying and selling behavior of LTHs (those who have held their assets for at least 155 days)&nbsp;to measure the shift in the number of coins held by these investors over a specific period.</p>



<p>When its value is positive, it indicates that LTHs are not selling, and remain optimistic about BTC’s future price performance. Conversely, when it turns negative, it suggests that these holders are selling or distributing their coins, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-stalls-whales-stay-sidelines/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">often in response</a> to market pressures, which is a bearish signal.</p>



<p>According to Kesmeci, BTC’s Long-Term Holder Net Position Change (30d sum) flipping positive is notable. This metric had remained below zero since October last week, signaling that LTHs were consistently selling their BTCs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The sellofs reached their lowest point on December 5, prompting a 32% dip in BTC’s price and marking the peak of a 6-month period of distribution by LTHs.</p>



<p>However, this trend has changed since April 6. The metric now sits above zero and is in an uptrend. Speaking on what this means, Kemesci added:</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“While it’s too early to say definitively, the growing positive momentum in this metric could be a sign that long-term conviction is returning to the market.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Moreover, BTC’s funding rate has remained positive amid its price troubles, confirming the bullish outlook above. At press time, this is at 0.0037%.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2832" height="804" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50.png" alt="" class="wp-image-686401" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50.png 2832w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-360x102.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-850x241.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-768x218.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-1536x436.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-2048x581.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Screenshot-2025-04-12-at-08.28.50-150x43.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2832px) 100vw, 2832px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTC Funding Rate. Source: <a href="https://www.coinglass.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Coinglass</a></figcaption></figure>



<p>The funding rate is the periodic payment exchanged between long and short traders in perpetual futures markets. It is designed to <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-decline-miners-join-selloff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">keep the futures</a> price close to the underlying asset&#8217;s spot price.</p>



<p>When it is positive like this, long traders are paying short traders. This indicates a bullish market sentiment, as more traders are betting on BTC’s price to climb.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-long-term-holders-set-the-stage-for-87-000-run">Long-Term Holders Set the Stage for $87,000 Run</h2>



<p>The surge in accumulation from BTC LTHs has pushed the coin’s price above the key resistance at $81,863. At press time, the king coin trades at $83,665.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the market responds to these sustained buying pressures from LTHs, the coin’s price may be primed for a significant rally in the near future.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If retail traders follow suit and <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/bitcoin-price-prediction" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase their</a> coin demand, BTC could break above $85,000 to $87,730.&nbsp;</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="2770" height="1432" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12.png" alt="BTC Price Analysis" class="wp-image-686402" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12.png 2770w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12-360x186.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12-850x439.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12-768x397.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12-1536x794.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12-2048x1059.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/BTCUSD_2025-04-12_08-30-12-150x78.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 2770px) 100vw, 2770px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">BTC Price Analysis.

<p>However, if the accumulation trend ends and these LTHs begin to sell for gains, BTC could resume its decline, fall below $81,863, and drop toward $74,389.&nbsp;</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Since early 2025, exchanges such as Cboe BZX and NYSE Arca have submitted proposals to the US SEC to incorporate staking services into existing spot ETFs. If approved, these funds could accelerate crypto adoption by giving traditional investors streamlined access to ETH.</strong></p>



<p>Brian Fabian Crain, CEO and Co-founder of Chorus One, told <em>BeInCrypto</em> he remains &#8220;cautiously optimistic&#8221; about the proposals gaining approval before the end of President Trump&#8217;s first term. Still, he emphasized that the SEC will likely focus on ensuring strict investor protections before moving forward.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-the-push-for-staked-ethereum-etfs-in-the-us"><strong>The Push for Staked Ethereum ETFs in the US</strong></h2>



<p>In mid-February, both Cboe BZX Exchange and NYSE Arca took steps towards Ethereum staking ETFs. Cboe BZX filed to amend the 21Shares ETF, while NYSE Arca followed two days later with a similar proposal for Grayscale&#8217;s ETF offerings.</p>



<p><a href="https://beincrypto.com/experts-warn-of-restaking-vulnerabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staking is a fundamental component of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) blockchains</a>. Instead of relying on energy-intensive mining, such as in <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/proof-of-work-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Proof-of-Work blockchains</a> like Bitcoin, PoS networks select participants.&nbsp;</p>



<p>These participants act as validators and are in charge of verifying and adding new transactions, or blocks, to the blockchain based on the amount of cryptocurrency they have &#8220;staked&#8221; or locked up.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<p>If approved, these <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/where-to-buy-ethereum-etf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum ETFs</a> would allow traditional investors to gain exposure to the cryptocurrency while also earning passive income by contributing to the security of the Ethereum network through staking.</p>



<p>This move would also represent another significant step forward for institutional crypto adoption.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The‬‭ approval‬‭ of‬‭ an‬‭ Ethereum‬‭ staking‬‭ ETF‬‭ would‬‭ mark‬‭ a‬‭ watershed‬‭ for‬‭ institutional‬‭ adoption.‬‭ Indeed,‬‭ a‬‭ staking-enabled‬‭ ETF‬‭ provides‬‭ a‬‭ regulated,‬‭ easy-to-access‬‭ exposure‬‭ to‬‭ ETH‬‭ that‬ includes‬‭ its‬‭ native‬‭ yield,‬‭ all‬‭ within‬‭ the‬‭ familiar‬‭ ETF‬‭ framework.‬‭ This‬‭ means‬‭ asset‬‭ managers‬‭ and‬ pensions‬‭ could‬‭ gain‬‭ passive‬‭ ETH‬‭ exposure‬‭ without‬‭ handling‬‭ private‬‭ keys‬‭ or‬‭ navigating‬‭ crypto‬‭ exchanges, significantly lowering operational barriers,” Crain told BeInCrypto.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It would also enhance Ethereum’s market position relative to other crypto assets.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-can-staking-yield-revitalize-ethereum-s-market-position"><strong>Can Staking Yield Revitalize Ethereum&#8217;s Market Position?</strong></h2>



<p>Throughout much of 2024 and early 2025, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bitcoin-ethereum-profitability-gap-increasing-for-two-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum&#8217;s price appreciation lagged significantly behind Bitcoin</a>. The ETH/BTC ratio hit a record low in early April 2025, indicating that Bitcoin was outperforming Ethereum.</p>



<p>Fluctuations in the broader crypto market <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-at-risk-of-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">further complicated Ethereum’s market position</a>. Earlier this month, the network <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-price-faces-its-biggest-crisis/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached its lowest price in two years</a>, eroding investor confidence.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With increasing support from exchanges and asset managers for an Ethereum-staking ETF, a development of this scale can potentially reposition Ethereum.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“One key differentiator of Ethereum is its ability to generate yield through staking — something Bitcoin doesn&#8217;t offer. Enabling that feature within an ETF makes Ethereum-based products more attractive and competitive. Ethereum’s ~3% annual staking yield is a major draw for investors and a clear distinction from Bitcoin. It means that even if ETH’s price growth trails Bitcoin’s, staked ETH can still deliver higher total returns thanks to the yield. By packaging this yield into an ETF, Ethereum becomes a more compelling investment option for institutions focused on income,” Crain explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Allowing staking within an ETF structure would spur greater ETH demand and investor appetite and enhance Ethereum&#8217;s security by expanding the validator pool and decentralizing staking across a wider range of holders. </p>



<p>Increased total staked ETH would further strengthen the network against attacks.</p>



<p>With other jurisdictions already legally permitting staking services, the United States might see their early adoption as a reason to act quickly and maintain a competitive edge.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-how-hong-kong-s-staking-approval-impacts-the-us-sec"><strong>How Hong Kong&#8217;s Staking Approval Impacts the US SEC</strong></h2>



<p>This week, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/top-10-blockchain-leaders-nation-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hong Kong’s Securities and Futures Commission (SFC)</a> announced new guidance allowing licensed crypto exchanges and funds in the city to offer staking services. Platforms must meet strict conditions before providing these services.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“‭The‬‭ SFC’s‬‭ framework‬‭ emphasizes‬‭ investor‬ protection‬‭ while‬‭ embracing‬‭ innovation.‬‭ For‬‭ example,‬‭ Hong‬‭ Kong‬‭ requires‬‭ that‬‭ platforms‬‭ retain‬‭ full control of client assets (no outsourcing) and disclose all staking risks transparently,” Crain explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hong Kong set itself apart from other jurisdictions like <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/top-crypto-trading-platforms-singapore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Singapore</a>, which banned retail staking in 2023, and the previous SEC’s administration on Gary Gensler, which took a historically restrictive approach.</p>



<p>Crain believes this new development will primarily exert competitive pressure on the SEC to follow accordingly.&nbsp;</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“‬‭As‬‭ a‬‭ major‬ international‬‭ financial‬‭ hub,‬‭ Hong‬‭ Kong’s‬‭ adoption‬‭ of‬‭ regulated‬‭ staking‬‭ sends‬‭ a‬‭ message:‬‭ it‬‭ is‬ possible‬‭ to‬‭ allow‬‭ staking‬‭ in‬‭ a‬‭ compliant‬‭ manner.‬‭ US‬‭ regulators‬‭ often‬‭ watch‬‭ regimes‬‭ like‬‭ Hong‬ Kong‬‭ as‬‭ bellwethers‬‭ for‬‭ emerging‬‭ best‬‭ practices.‬‭ The‬‭ SEC‬‭ will‬‭ take‬‭ note‬‭ that‬‭ Hong‬‭ Kong‬‭ is‬‭ not‬ only‬‭ allowing‬‭ staking‬‭ but‬‭ even‬‭ paving‬‭ the‬‭ way‬‭ for‬‭ staking‬‭ services‬‭ in‬‭ ETFs‬‭ (the‬‭ SFC’s‬‭ rules‬ mention authorized virtual asset funds can offer staking under certain caps and conditions),” he said.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>‭Incorporating staking into Hong Kong-listed crypto ETFs would put US funds and exchanges at a competitive disadvantage if the SEC maintains its prohibition.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When reviewing the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/grayscale-top-20-list-altcoins-q2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">21Shares and Grayscale applications</a>, the SEC may need to consider that global investors could turn to international markets to access these staking ETF products if the US doesn&#8217;t eventually allow them.</p>



<p>While the competitive aspect is a factor, the SEC will also need to address various complexities inherent in Ethereum staking, which may be obstacles to final approval.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-the-investment-contract-conundrum"><strong>The &#8220;Investment Contract&#8221; Conundrum</strong></h2>



<p>Among the most important factors the SEC will consider is whether staking programs constitute investment contracts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The previous administration&#8217;s SEC targeted <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-coinbase-kraken-sec-crypto-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">centralized exchanges like Kraken and Coinbase</a> for operating staking services considered unregistered profit schemes and violating US securities laws.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In centralized exchanges, users must effectively transfer custody of their cryptocurrency to a third-party entity that manages staking and the distribution of rewards. However, this model is distinct from the process inherent in Ethereum, a decentralized blockchain.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“Unlike‬‭ exchange‬‭ staking‬‭ programs‬‭,‬‭ an‬‭ ETF‬‭ staking‬‭ its‬‭ own‬‭ assets‬‭ isn’t‬‭ ‘selling’‬‭ a‬‭ staking‬‭ service‬‭ to‬‭ others,‬‭ it’s‬‭ directly‬‭ participating‬‭ in‬‭ network‬‭ consensus.‬ This‬‭ nuance,‬‭ emphasized‬‭ in‬‭ recent‬‭ filings‬‭ and‬‭ comment‬‭ letters,‬‭ is‬‭ contributing‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ SEC’s‬‭ willingness‬‭ to‬‭ reconsider its stance.‬‭ Essentially,‬‭ the‬‭ argument‬‭ is‬‭ that‬‭ staking‬‭ is‬‭ a‬‭ core‬‭ technical‬‭ feature‬‭ of‬‭ Ethereum,‬‭ not‬‭ an‬‭ ancillary‬‭ investment‬‭ product,” Crain told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>While an ETF staking its assets presents a different model, the SEC will look closely for security violations. Addressing this concern requires demonstrating that protocol rewards originate inherently from the decentralized network, not the sponsor&#8217;s business efforts.</p>



<p>This issue, though largely conceptual, is critical; SEC approval hinges on satisfying securities law requirements regarding staking.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, slashing risks are another issue of concern.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-slashing-risks-a-unique-challenge-for-ethereum-staking-etfs"><strong>Slashing Risks: A Unique Challenge for Ethereum Staking ETFs?</strong></h2>



<p>A key difference from traditional commodity funds is that a staking ETF must actively participate in network consensus, exposing it to the potential for slashing.</p>



<p>Slashing is a penalty where a portion of the staked ETH can be destroyed if a validator acts improperly or makes mistakes. For investors, the ETF&#8217;s principal could suffer partial losses due to operational errors, a risk not present in non-staking ETFs.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“‬‭The‬‭ SEC‬‭ will‬‭ assess‬‭ how‬‭ significant‬‭ this‬‭ risk‬‭ is‬‭ and‬‭ whether‬‭ it’s‬‭ been‬‭ mitigated.‬‭ Filings‬‭ note‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ Sponsor‬‭ will‬‭ not‬‭ cover‬‭ slashing‬‭ losses‬‭ on‬‭ behalf‬‭ of‬‭ the‬‭ trust,‬‭ meaning‬‭ investors‬‭ bear‬‭ that‬‭ risk.‬‭ This‬‭ forces‬‭ the‬‭ SEC‬‭ to‬‭ consider‬‭ if‬‭ average‬‭ investors‬‭ can‬‭ tolerate‬‭ the‬‭ possibility‬‭ of‬‭ losing‬‭ funds‬‭ not‬‭ due‬‭ to‬‭ market‬‭ movement‬‭ but‬‭ due‬‭ to‬‭ a‬‭ technical‬‭ protocol‬‭ penalty.‬‭ This‬‭ risk‬‭ must‬‭ be‬‭ transparently disclosed and managed in any approved product,” Crain explained.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Typically, custodians have insurance for <a href="https://beincrypto.com/tech-giants-enhance-cybersecurity-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">asset loss due to theft or cyberattacks</a>. However, slashing is a protocol-enforced penalty, not traditional &#8220;theft,&#8221; and many custody insurance policies might not cover it. Therefore, the SEC will likely inquire about the safeguards should a slashing event occur.</p>



<p>This novel aspect of Ethereum staking creates certain ambiguities in accounting treatment.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The‬‭ SEC‬‭ will‬‭ scrutinize‬‭ how‬‭ the‬‭ custodian‬‭ reports‬‭ on‬‭ staked‬‭ holdings.‬‭ The‬‭ ETF’s‬‭ [net asset value‭ accounting‬‭ needs‬‭ to‬‭ capture‬‭ both‬‭ the‬‭ base‬‭ ETH‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ accumulated‬‭ rewards.‬‭ Custodians‬‭ will likely‬‭ provide‬‭ reporting‬‭ on‬‭ how‬‭ much‬‭ ETH‬‭ is‬‭ staked‬‭ versus‬‭ liquid,‬‭ and‬‭ any‬‭ rewards‬‭ received.‬‭ The‬‭ SEC‬‭ will‬‭ require‬‭ independent‬‭ audits‬‭ or‬‭ attestations‬‭ confirming‬‭ that‬‭ the‬‭ custodian‬‭ indeed‬‭ holds‬‭ the‬‭ ETH‬‭ it‬‭ claims‬‭ (both‬‭ original‬‭ and‬‭ any‬‭ newly‬‭ awarded‬‭ ETH)‬‭ and‬‭ that‬‭ controls‬‭ around‬‭ staking are effective,” Crain explained.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Liquidity risks associated with <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-restaking-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum staking</a> are another factor to consider.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-further-sec-considerations"><strong>Further SEC Considerations</strong></h2>



<p>A key detail the SEC will examine is that staked ETH lacks instant liquidity.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Even after the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-on-chain-activity-cranks-shanghai-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shanghai upgrade enabled withdrawals in 2023</a>, the Ethereum protocol still incorporates delays and queues that prevent staked ETH from being instantly liquid upon initiating the unstaking process.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“The‬‭ SEC‬‭ will‬‭ examine‬‭ how‬‭ the‬‭ fund‬‭ handles‬‭ redemption‬‭ requests‬‭ if‬‭ a‬‭ large‬‭ portion‬‭ of‬‭ assets‬‭ are‬‭ locked‬‭ in‬‭ staking.‬‭ For‬‭ example,‬‭ exiting‬‭ a‬‭ validator‬‭ position‬‭ can‬‭ take‬‭ from‬‭ days‬‭ to‬‭ weeks‬‭ if‬‭ there’s‬‭ a‬‭ backlog‬‭ (due‬‭ to‬‭ the‬‭ network’s‬‭ exit‬‭ queue‬‭ and‬‭ “churn‬‭ limit”‬‭ on‬‭ how‬‭ many‬‭ validators‬‭ can‬‭ unlock‬‭ per‬‭ epoch),” Chain told BeInCrypto.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>During heavy outflows,‬‭ the‬‭ fund‬‭ might‬‭ not‬‭ immediately‬‭ access‬‭ all‬‭ its‬‭ ETH‬‭ to‬‭ meet‬‭ redemptions.‬‭ The‬‭ SEC‬‭ sees‬‭ this‬‭ as‬‭ a‬‭ structural‬‭ complexity that could harm investors if not planned for.‬</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“In‬‭ a‬‭ worst-case‬‭ scenario,‬‭ if‬‭ the‬‭ ETF‬‭ had‬‭ to‬‭ wait‬‭ days‬‭ or‬‭ weeks‬‭ to‬‭ fully‬‭ exit‬‭ staking‬‭ positions,‬‭ an‬‭ investor‬‭ redeeming‬‭ could‬‭ either‬‭ wait‬‭ longer‬‭ for‬‭ their‬‭ proceeds‬‭ or‬‭ get‬‭ paid‬‭ in-kind‬‭ with‬‭ staked‬‭ ETH‬‭ (which‬‭ they‬‭ then‬‭ must‬‭ figure‬‭ out‬‭ how‬‭ to‬‭ redeem‬‭ themselves).‬‭ This‬‭ isn’t‬‭ a‬‭ typical‬‭ concern‬‭ in‬‭ ETFs‬‭ and‬‭ is‬‭ a‬‭ potential‬‭ downside‬‭ for‬‭ investors‬‭ expecting high liquidity,” Crain added.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Finally, there are also security risks that must be addressed responsibly.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-the-point-and-click-model"><strong>The &#8220;Point-and-Click&#8221; Model</strong></h2>



<p>Securing custody for Ethereum in an ETF is already crucial, and adding staking will increase the SEC&#8217;s scrutiny.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“‬The‬‭ SEC‬‭ will‬‭ examine‬‭ how‬‭ the‬‭ ETF’s‬‭ custodian‬‭ secures‬‭ the‬‭ ETH‬‭ private‬‭ keys,‬‭ especially‬‭ since‬‭ those‬‭ keys‬‭ (or‬‭ derivative‬‭ keys)‬‭ will‬‭ be‬‭ used‬‭ to‬‭ stake.‬‭ Normally,‬‭ custodians‬‭ use‬‭ cold‬‭ storage‬‭ for‬‭ crypto‬‭ assets,‬‭ but‬‭ staking‬‭ requires‬‭ keys‬‭ to‬‭ be‬‭ online‬‭ in‬‭ a‬‭ validator.‬‭ The‬‭ challenge‬‭ is‬‭ to‬‭ minimize‬‭ exposure while still participating in staking,” Crain said.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Recognizing the vulnerability of keys during validator activation, the SEC will most likely require custodians to use cutting-edge security modules to prevent hacking. Any prior incidents of security breaches involving a custodian would raise serious concerns.</p>



<p>Aiming to lessen these risks, some exchanges have proposed that the ETH for staking remain within the custodian&#8217;s control at all times. This model is largely referred to as a “point-and-click” mechanism.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“NYSE‬‭ Arca’s‬‭ proposal‬‭ to‬‭ allow‬‭ the‬‭ Grayscale‬‭ Ethereum‬‭ Trust‬‭ (and‬‭ a‬‭ smaller‬‭ ‘Mini’‬‭ trust)‬‭ to‬‭ stake‬‭ its‬‭ Ether‬‭ via‬‭ a‬‭ ‘point-and-click’‬‭ mechanism‬‭ is‬‭ a‬‭ test‬‭ case‬‭ that‬‭ will‬‭ significantly‬‭ inform‬‭ the‬‭ SEC’s‬‭ evaluation‬‭ of‬‭ staking‬‭ in‬‭ an‬‭ ETF‬‭ context.‬‭ The‬‭ point-and-click‬‭ staking‬‭ model‬‭ is‬‭ essentially‬‭ a‬‭ way‬‭ to‬‭ stake‬‭ without‬‭ altering‬‭ the‬‭ fundamental‬‭ custody‬‭ or‬‭ introducing‬‭ extra‬‭ complexities‬‭ for‬‭ investors.‬‭ In‬‭ practice,‬‭ this‬‭ means‬‭ the‬‭ trust’s‬‭ custodian‬‭ would‬‭ simply‬‭ enable‬‭ staking‬‭ on‬‭ the‬‭ held‬‭ ETH‬‭ through‬‭ an‬‭ interface.‬‭ The‬‭ coins‬‭ don’t‬‭ leave‬‭ the‬‭ custody‬‭ wallet,‬‭ and‬‭ the‬‭ process‬‭ is‬‭ as‬‭ straightforward as clicking a button,” Crain explained.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The proposal directly tackles the SEC&#8217;s security worries by emphasizing that the ETH never leaves the custodian, thereby minimizing the theft risk. Furthermore, it clarifies that the yield is generated automatically by the network, not through the entrepreneurial endeavors of a third party.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-when-will-the-sec-approve-staking-in-ethereum-etfs"><strong>When Will the SEC Approve Staking in Ethereum ETFs?</strong></h2>



<p>Despite the complexities and technical details of <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/eth-etf-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staking in Ethereum ETFs</a>, the prevailing political climate in the US could <a href="https://beincrypto.com/how-paul-atkins-will-reset-us-crypto-policy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lead to a more favorable environment</a> for their eventual approval.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“On balance, it now seems more likely than not that the SEC will approve a staking feature for Ethereum ETFs in the relatively near future. A more receptive SEC leadership post-2025, strong political backing for staking in ETPs, and well-crafted proposals addressing earlier concerns — such as the point-and-click model — all tilt the odds toward approval. A year or two ago, the SEC was firmly opposed. Now, the conversation has shifted to ‘how to do this safely,’ which marks a significant change,” Crain told BeInCrypto.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That said, Crain cautioned that the SEC will not approve an ETF of this kind until it&#8217;s fully satisfied with the investor protections in place. Even so, the overall outlook remains positive.</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>“‬‭Considering‬‭ all‬‭ the‬‭ factors‬‭ discussed,‬‭ the‬‭ outlook‬‭ for‬‭ an‬‭ Ethereum‬‭ staking‬‭ ETF‬‭ approval‬‭ appears‬‭ cautiously‬‭ optimistic.‬‭ The‬‭ likelihood‬‭ of‬‭ eventual‬‭ approval‬‭ is‬‭ growing,‬‭ though‬‭ the‬‭ timing‬‭ remains a subject of debate,” Crain concluded.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the best-case scenario, an Ethereum staking ETF could gain approval by the end of 2025.</p>

<p>The post <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-binance-file-for-pause-in-lawsuit/">SEC and Binance Request Second Pause on Lawsuit, Citing &#8220;Productive&#8221; Talks</a> appeared first on <a href="https://beincrypto.com">BeInCrypto</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>The SEC and Binance filed a joint motion to pause their lawsuit for 60 days. They requested a prior pause 60 days ago and have &#8220;been in productive discussions&#8221; since then.  </strong></p>



<p>Both parties have asked for more time to finalize an agreement and consider all the relevant policy implications. In the main, however, it&#8217;s a substantially similar agreement to the one between the SEC and Ripple yesterday.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-binance-and-sec-discussing-a-settlement">Binance and SEC Discussing a Settlement</h2>



<p>The SEC has been <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-drops-gemini-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dropping a lot of its most prominent enforcement actions lately</a>, such as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ripple-vs-sec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its lawsuit against Ripple</a>. Still, despite this progress, a few outstanding cases remain. </p>



<p>The SEC has been ending lawsuits against <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-drops-coinbase-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prominent exchanges</a> like Coinbase<a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-drops-kraken-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and Kraken</a>, and now it&#8217;s <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/67474542/298/securities-and-exchange-commission-v-binance-holdings-limited/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preparing</a> to drop one against Binance:</p>



<blockquote class="max-w-xl text-4.5 border-l-2 border-blue-600 pl-11 mb-9 select-all [&#038;_p]:!mb-0 wp-block-quote is-layout-flow wp-block-quote-is-layout-flow">
<p>&#8220;Pursuant to the Court’s February 13, 2025 Minute Order, Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission and Defendants Binance Holdings Limited&#8230; and Changpeng Zhao submit this joint status report and jointly move to continue to stay this case for a period of 60 additional days,&#8221; a motion filed today read. </p>
</blockquote>



<p>Binance is <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/binance-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the world&#8217;s largest crypto exchange</a>, and it has been engaged in this fight since 2023. The SEC <a href="https://beincrypto.com/sec-sues-binance-crypto-exchange-regulators/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued Binance in June</a> of that year, alleging that it committed a few serious crimes. </p>



<p>In addition to violating securities laws, the Commission also claims that Binance deliberately lied to regulators. This caused <a href="https://beincrypto.com/binance-assets-decline/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">serious problems for its business</a>, prompting a lengthy battle.</p>



<p>The SEC, however, is under new management now. Paul Atkins is <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/who-is-paul-atkins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Commission&#8217;s new Chair</a>, and he&#8217;s <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;"><a href="https://beincrypto.com/paul-atkins-crypto-regulation-priorities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">prioritized friendly crypto regulation.</a> </span></p>



<p><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">Before his confirmation, the SEC, under Acting Chair Mark Uyeda, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/binance-sec-pause-legal-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">filed a joint request with Binance</a> to pause the lawsu</span>it 60 days ago, and they&#8217;re asking for another extension.</p>



<p>Today&#8217;s filing is slightly shorter than the <a href="https://x.com/EleanorTerrett/status/1889175581423796304" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">previous</a> one, but it suggests that real progress has been made. It claims that Binance and the SEC &#8220;have been in productive discussions&#8221; concerning the <a href="https://beincrypto.com/hester-peirce-sec-crypto-task-force/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crypto Task Force</a> and broader policy implications of a settlement. However, they still need more time to fully consider a resolution. </p>



<p>This agreement <span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">is similar to the one filed yesterday. Specifically, the Commission also requested a 60-day pause in a <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ripple-sec-file-joint-motion-settlement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cross-appeal from Ripple</a>, attempting to tie up loose ends without wasting the court&#8217;s resources. </span></p>



<p><span style="margin: 0px; padding: 0px;">There are a few subtle differences, but Binance&#8217;s filing with the SEC attempts</span> to meet the same basic goals.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[
<p><strong>Crypto whales are making bold moves following Donald Trump’s 90-day tariff pause, with Ethereum (ETH), Mantra (OM), and Onyxcoin (XCN) drawing significant accumulation. </strong></p>



<p>ETH whales pushed holdings to their highest level since September 2023, while OM holders are quietly increasing exposure amid the growing real-world asset narrative. XCN, meanwhile, saw a sharp spike in whale activity alongside a 50% price surge in just 24 hours.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-ethereum-eth">Ethereum (ETH)</h2>



<p>The broader <a href="https://beincrypto.com/bullish-altcoins-trumps-tariff-pause/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crypto market rallied after Donald Trump announced a 90-day pause on tariffs</a>—excluding China—boosting investor sentiment across risk assets. </p>



<p>Ethereum followed suit, with on-chain data showing a rise in crypto whales activity; the number of addresses holding between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH climbed from 5,376 to 5,417 between April 9 and 10, reaching its highest level since September 2023.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" decoding="async" width="3840" height="1300" src="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025.png" alt="Number of Addresses Holding Between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH." class="wp-image-686186" srcset="https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025.png 3840w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-360x122.png 360w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-850x288.png 850w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-768x260.png 768w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-1536x520.png 1536w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-2048x693.png 2048w, https://beincrypto.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Ethereum-ETH-10.02.14-11-Apr-2025-150x51.png 150w" sizes="(max-width: 3840px) 100vw, 3840px" /><figcaption class="wp-element-caption">Number of Addresses Holding Between 1,000 and 10,000 ETH.

<p>If Ethereum can maintain this renewed momentum, it may test key resistance levels at $1,749 and potentially rally further toward $1,954 and $2,104. However, macroeconomic uncertainty still looms. </p>



<p>A sentiment reversal could see <a href="https://beincrypto.com/learn/ethereum-price-prediction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ethereum price</a> retesting the $1,412 support zone. If that level fails, a deeper decline toward $1,200—or even $1,000—is possible. </p>



<p>Some analysts have gone as far as <a href="https://beincrypto.com/ethereum-solana-nokia-irrelevance-risk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comparing Ethereum’s decline to Nokia’s historical collapse</a>, warning of long-term structural weakness.</p>

<p>With the RWA narrative gaining traction, OM could see significant upside. Between April 6 and April 10, the number of OM whale addresses holding between 10,000 and 100,000 tokens rose from 386 to 389, signaling quiet accumulation. </p>



<p>If OM breaks past the resistance levels at $6.51 and $6.85, it could climb above $7. However, if the momentum fades, a correction could push the token down to $6.11, with further downside risk toward $5.68.</p>



<h2 class="bic-gutenberg-heading wp-heading wp-block-heading" id="h-onyxcoin-xcn">Onyxcoin (XCN)</h2>

<p>If this strong bullish momentum continues, <a href="https://beincrypto.com/onyxcoin-price-finds-whale-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XCN could rally</a> toward resistance levels at $0.026, $0.033, and even $0.040. However, given the rapid price increase in a short timeframe, a correction may follow. </p>



<p>In that case, XCN could retest support at $0.020, with potential downside extending to $0.014 if selling pressure accelerates.</p>
